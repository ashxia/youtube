Marriage is something that is so important to people. In fact, you probably thought about what your wedding would be like as a child.
When people go into a marriage they think so much about their venue, their cake, their guest list — but they never really think about what they are signing up for. Marriage is, legally, one of the most important things you can do. You are signing away half of your life. And there’s nothing wrong with that – if it’s the right person.

On this episode of The School of Greatness, I brought on someone who knows so much about people being with the wrong person and how to set yourself up for a great marriage: NYC divorce attorney James Sexton.

He’s the former Disney film distribution chief who was responsible for the relaunch of the Star Wars franchise, the Avengers series, and mega-hits like Frozen and Beauty and the Beast, but he left his prestigious post at Disney last year to lead The Hollis Company alongside his wife Rachel Hollis.

In addition to running a company and raising his four beautiful children, Dave is touring the US, regaling tales of how one former personal development skeptic became a spokesperson for growth.

Dave understands the path to success well and acknowledges that it’s a path full of change. It requires not only strategy but also the willingness to grow and adapt to situations you never saw coming.

I had Dave’s wife, Rachel Hollis, author of Girl, Wash Your Face, on my podcast a while back, and I was so excited to have Dave on here as well! He gets vulnerable talking about their marriage and how they’ve navigated all this crazy stuff together.

I think you all are really gonna enjoy this one. Join me on Episode 926 to learn how to get out of your own way so you can reach your fullest potential with Dave Hollis.

This is audio podcast number #403 with MIke Rowe

Mike Rowe is a TV host, writer, narrator, producer, actor and spokesman. His performing career began in 1984, when he faked his way into the Baltimore Opera to get his union card and meet girls, both of which he accomplished during a performance of Rigoletto. His transition to television occurred in 1990 when — to settle a bet — he auditioned for the QVC Shopping Channel and was promptly hired after talking about a pencil for nearly eight minutes. There, he worked the graveyard shift for three years, until he was ultimately fired for making fun of products and belittling viewers.

Reverend Michael Beckwith is a sought after meditation teacher, conference speaker, and seminar leader on the Life Visioning Process. He’s also the founder and spiritual director of the Agape International Spiritual Center, and one of LA’s foremost black leaders. 

Micahel is the author of several books, including Life Visioning, Spiritual Liberation, and The Answer Is You. Michael has also appeared on several TV shows, including Oprah Winfrey’s SuperSoul Sunday, Dr. Oz, CNN, and Larry King Live. Every Friday at 1 pm Pacific Time, thousands of people tune into his radio show, The Sound of Transformation, which is all about recognizing the deep potential in all of us to create positive change.

Michael is an old friend of mine, and I was honored that he had this conversation with me. I had him on The School of Greatness back on Episode 748, and you should definitely check that out to learn more about the power of pain and his struggle with racism. 

Martin Luther King said, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” I have chosen not to be silent. I have much to learn, but even in my ignorance, I can stand in solidarity with the black community. I sincerely hope you will stand with me and make positive change happen. 

We’re not here to make people comfortable. We’re here to make people great. In addition to listening Episode 962 with Michael, please join me educating ourselves about allyship and how we can be actively anti-racist."

Randy Jackson is a music industry veteran, television producer, author, and entrepreneur. He has recorded music on multiple albums for bands and artists like Journey, Maze, and Kenny G, and has excelled in his own musical career as a bassist and a singer.

In 1999, Randy found out he had type 2 diabetes. He had no choice but to divorce his current lifestyle. He changed his diet and exercise routine and underwent gastric-bypass surgery in 2003 which led to him losing 100-pounds.

Randy is a real person. He doesn’t be who you want him to be – he is who is. He embraces his differences, follows his passions, and is not afraid of change.

Check Out The School Of Greatness - https://lewishowes.com/start-here/

Dr. Joe Dispenza is an international lecturer, researcher, corporate consultant, New York Times bestselling author, and educator who has been invited to speak in more than 33 countries on 6 continents. As a lecturer and educator, he is driven by the conviction that each of us has the potential for greatness and unlimited abilities.

In his easy-to-understand, compassionate style, he has educated thousands of people, detailing how they can rewire their brains and recondition their bodies to make lasting changes. His most recent book, Becoming Supernatural, talks about how we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical, transcendental experiences and develop a more healthy body, mind, and spiritual life.

I’ve had Dr. Joe on The School of Greatness a couple times now, and I was so excited to have him back on today. We couldn’t meet in person due to the coronavirus, but we conducted a video interview together that I think you’re really going to enjoy. If you haven’t already, check out our past interviews (Episode 826 and Episode 679) — they are all really applicable to what we are going through right now.

In the hard times we are currently facing, it is so important to take a moment to refocus our minds to prevent ourselves from spiraling into anxiety. Anxiety and depression can chemically change our bodies and even suppress our immune system, and now more than ever, it’s important for us to keep that from happening.

Attitude is everything. When we do feel anxious, there are things we can do to recenter ourselves and raise our consciousness to a higher level. To learn how join me on Episode 933 with the incredible Dr. Joe Dispenza.

Chase Jarvis is an American artist, director, entrepreneur and author who co-founded the on-line educational platform Creative Live. Chase consistently uses his voice to educate and inspire people to achieve their creative potential.

 As a child, Chase Jarvis loved being creative and started making his own films, but after overhearing his teacher tell his parents “Chase is so much better at sports than arts”, he lost his creative passion and replaced it with a need to achieve athletically. In the following years he became a standout athlete in multiple sports, but his grandfather’s death reignited his creative spirit and since that time he has lived a creative life putting his creative spirit into everything he does. Now, his mission is to help people tap into their creative potential.

Dan Harris is a correspondent for ABC News and the co-anchor for the weekend edition of Good Morning America. Before that, he was the anchor of the Sunday edition of World News. He regularly contributes stories for such shows as Nightline, 20/20, World News with Diane Sawyer, and GMA.

Dan overworked himself. He was in a hypercompetitive environment where the grind never stopped, and he was a skeptic of self-care and self-love. But one day, he had a nationally televised panic attack on Good Morning America that showed him he couldn’t continue living life the way he had. It made him start to concentrate on his mental health and learn how to be a little happier every day. Dan used to believe meditation was useless, but now he uses that tool to recenter his psyche and body into a calmer, safer place. 

I’m so excited to bring you this episode because it’s focused on one of the biggest goals that all of us share: being happier. Dan studied meditation and wrote the #1 New York Times Bestseller, 10% Happier, which he also turned into a podcast and an app. Dan’s objective is to help people who are skeptical about meditation — because he once was too — while also connecting with those already on their mental and spiritual journeys.

In our last episode together, Dan shared more about his panic attack on Good Morning America and how it caused him to turn his life around. In this interview, Dan and I discuss simple ways to raise our happiness, accept ourselves, and shares about the benefits of meditation.

Join me on Episode 958 to learn how you can become 10% happier every day with the inspirational Dan Harris!" "UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA" "Lewis Howes" "14318" "377" "10" "0" "44" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H1FI3cFJjY"

He is a Grammy Award­ winner as a principal soloist on Hamilton’s Original Broadway Cast Recording, which won the 2015 award for Best Musical Theater Album.

Odom, Jr. made his Broadway debut at the age of  17 in “Rent” before heading to Carnegie Mellon University’s prestigious School of Drama, where he graduated with honors. He is the recipient of a 2002 Princess Grace Award for Acting, which is dedicated to identifying emerging talent in theater, dance and film.

Additional theatre credits include “Leap of Faith” on Broadway, for which he won the 2012 Astaire Award for Outstanding Male Dancer on Broadway and was nominated for a Drama League Award; the 2014 musical “Venice,” which also played at The Public Theater; and the Encores! Off­ Center production of “Tick, Tick... Boom!” which was his first time working with “Hamilton” creator, Lin­-Manuel Miranda.
-----
When Leslie started, his only dream was to be in Rent. When he made it, he was left to find a new dream. He struggled for a long time not finding any work. One day his eyes were opened by a mentor as to what he was doing wrong. He wasn’t respecting his industry.

He had to show the universe what he wanted. He started taking beginner acting classes, and really researching every brand, role, producer, writer, etc before going out for an audition. The moment he made this mind shift, the universe responded and he was booked non stop for six years.

Amazing.

You really need to learn from his wisdom on this one.So, learn how to combat your fear of failure, mentally prepare for huge opportunity, and how to be an advocate for yourself, on Episode 677.

If you don’t know Dave, he’s a political commentator and comedian and the host of the Rubin Report on YouTube (and wherever you got your podcasts). He’s committed to, in his own words, free speech and big ideas, and his iconoclastic thinking has often made him the source of controversy.

Dave’s journey from a left-leaning progressive to a free-thinking classical liberal has been quite an adventure. As a gay married man living in America, Dave spent the majority of his adult life subscribing to a certain political belief system. Fed up with the mainstream media narrative and click-bait news, Dave decided to open up about his awakening for all to see. He realized that no person or idea should be expected to join a side, but rather they should embrace their status as an individual. 

Dave’s background as a stand-up comedian, his degree in political science, and his willingness to listen without fighting has uniquely positioned him to tackle big ideas and uncomfortable truths with thought leaders from both sides of the aisle. His show The Rubin Report aims to create civil discourse with people who disagree with each other. He aims to host a dialogue with others where ideas aren’t judged before people have the chance to explain.

Dave was recently touring with Jordan Peterson, who came on The School of Greatness for an amazing two-part interview last year. If you liked those podcasts, you’ll definitely like this.

https://twitter.com/nilofer
https://www.instagram.com/nilofer/

Nilofer Merchant is a master at turning seemingly “wild” ideas into new realities and showing the rest of us how we can too.  She has done so through her books, her top ranked TED talk, and her accomplishments at Fortune 500 companies and startups. So much so that she was awarded the Future Thinker Award from Thinkers50, which ranks the world’s leading business thinkers and which also named her the #1 person most likely to influence the future of management in both theory and practice.

She has personally launched more than 100 products, netting $18B in sales and has held executive positions at everywhere from Fortune 500 companies like Apple and Autodesk to startups in the early days of the Web (Golive/ later bought by Adobe). Logitech, Symantec, HP, Yahoo, VMWare, and many others have turned to her guidance on new product strategies, entering new markets, defending against competitors, and optimizing revenues. Merchant is one of the few people who can say they’ve fought a competitive battle against Microsoft and won, for Symantec’s Anti-Virus $2.1B annual business. She has served on boards for both public and private companies, as well as on governance boards on public policies.

The author of two previous books on how organizations can better employ new ideas, Merchant’s latest, THE POWER OF ONLYNESS: Make Your Wild Ideas Mighty Enough to Dent the World (Viking Hardcover, August 29, 2017), shares her insider expertise with general readers to reveal new ways of connecting our ideas to the world around us in an era when the potential to make a difference is no longer bound by social status.

It’s hard to think that without having any business experience I could go from sleeping on my sister’s couch to running a seven figure business in a couple years.

Now I’m committed to impacting 100 million lives. I teach people how to pursue the dream that burns inside them and how to earn a full time income while making an impact on the world and others.

I do this through my podcast, videos, books, online courses, live events, experiential workshops and one on one interactions.

I’m so grateful where life has taken me and the life that I’ve chosen to design on a daily basis. I believe we are the authors of our own life, and I’m blessed for the adversity I’ve faced. It makes me appreciate my life now and have compassion for others who suffer in a much bigger way.
I’m often asked to mentor others, and the way I do this is through my podcast so I can maximize my time and impact more people. If you have a question, I’ve probably answered it on one of my episodes.

Please say hi over on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube or Twitter as I love to hear what each episode is bringing up for you and the lessons you are learning.

Always remember you were born for a reason, a purpose and something bigger than yourself. But YOU have to activate this calling; no one is going to turn it on for you! It’s Your Responsibility to build yourself into the person who can live a great life. No one is going to give you the power to develop your mental strength, emotional intelligence and physical health to have the life you want. That’s between you and you!

Gary and his family immigrated to the US from Belarus in 1978. He lived with 8 family members in a studio apartment in Queens, New York, before relocating to Edison, New Jersey. Gary often calls himself a “purebred entrepreneur,” having successfully started a lemonade franchise at age 7 and eventually selling tens of thousands of dollars worth of baseball cards and toys throughout his high school career.

At 14, he joined his family business bagging ice for $2/hr. When Gary identified “the internet” as a land-grab opportunity in the late ’90s, he transitioned his father’s local liquor store into one of the first e-commerce platforms for alcohol in the country resulting in explosive top-line growth. Renaming the business to “Wine Library,” Gary grew his father’s company from $3-60MM in sales during his tenure at Wine Library.

After growing his family business through what Gary calls “underpriced attention,” including the impact of content, e-commerce, email marketing, and Google AdWords, Gary began his own journey of producing original business content as the voice of entrepreneurship online.

Gary is currently the chairman of VaynerX, a modern-day media and communications holding company, and the active CEO of VaynerMedia, a full-service advertising agency servicing Fortune 100 clients across the company’s 4 locations. Today, Gary has more than 12M combined followers across social media. He’s the host of The GaryVee Audio Experience, a top 100 global podcast, and host of #AskGaryVee, a business and advice Q&A show on both YouTube and Facebook. 

Gary is a highly sought after public speaker, a 5-time New York Times bestselling author, as well as a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, and Uber. The list of his accomplishments, business endeavors, and charitable donations truly goes on and on!

As a teenager, he was a troublemaker. He never would have thought his life of drugs and stealing cars would turn into the life of a monk.

He made it to college and did well, but as soon as he graduated, he decided to go to India to spend three years studying how to find inner peace with monks.

After three years Jay was asked to leave the monkhood. He was told he could do more good sharing to the world than staying in the monastery.

Heartbroken, Jay left and eventually found the power of YouTube. He has gained amazing international success sharing the lessons he’s learned from his time as a monk teaching ancient wisdom on modern platforms.

You will be surprised at how much of these lessons don’t just apply to life but also to business.

Using determination, persistence, and belief, Les unleashed a course of amazing achievements including broadcast station manager, political commentator, and multi-term state representative in Ohio.

For three decades he has not only studied the science of achievement, but he’s also mastered it by interviewing hundreds of successful business leaders and collaborating with them in the boardroom translating theory into bottom-line results for his clients.

Les Brown never tires of using his energies to transform the world, well-beyond the podium and public appearances, meshing traditional and social media to empower his audiences. Hundreds of thousands are watching him on YouTube and tens of thousands interact with him regularly on Facebook.

When I first sat down with motivational speaking icon Les Brown — back in 2017 — I was blown away by his attitude toward life. I felt like I had so much more to ask him, and I’m fortunate I got another chance to interview him in this unique moment in the world. Les is also out with a new book called You’ve Got to Be Hungry! which distills everything he’s learned over the past four decades about finding your inner greatness. It’s definitely a book you don’t want to miss.

Through this journey, I’ve become aware of the things that have been holding me back as a human being, not just as a man, but as a human, in terms of being resentful, guarded, frustrated and defensive. But I recognize men and women might wonder, \"What’s in this book specifically for me?\"

WHAT’S IN IT FOR MEN?

Men will:

Understand what holds you back from your most powerful self
Develop an unwavering foundation of confidence in any situation
Propel you to a level of power and success that you may have never thought possible
Embrace and let go of any fears that hold you back from your dreams
Let go of all pressure, stress, and anxiety, so you can finally feel free
Experience more joy, happiness, and love in all of your relationships
WHAT’S IN IT FOR WOMEN?

Women will:

Understand the men in your life better
Learn ways you can emotionally support the men you love
Learn powerful tools to connect more intimately in your relationships
Learn how to get men you love to open up and be more vulnerable
Understand what holds the men in your life back
Understand why men act guarded, and how to help them open up
IT’S TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY.

Their mission is to access that hard drive and reset it – to turn on those longevity genes. They’ve learned that the sooner you start turning those on, the better.

“We now know from studying twins that 80% of your health in old age is up to you, how you live your life.” – Dr. David Sinclair

So how do you turn them on? There are five simple steps:

#1. First of all, don’t smoke. We’ve all heard this before – cigarettes will kill you – but with the rise of smoking alternatives, such as vaping, this warning is still very applicable. The chemicals we put in our lungs have a significant effect on our body chemistry and health. Smoking damages cellular DNA and accelerates the aging process – It’s undeniable. David’s mother died from lung cancer. She smoked, and years later, had a tumor the size of a grapefruit in her left lung. They took out the tumor, and she lived another 20 years, but in excruciating pain and hardship.

#2. Second, don’t eat too much. And that doesn’t just apply to the “unhealthy foods” – it applies to food in general. Dr. Sinclair isn’t recommending malnutrition, of course, but a healthy amount of intermittent fasting. Skipping a meal a day is okay, even if you’re an athlete. He recommends to stop eating when you’re about 60 or 70% full. We’re conditioned to eat the food in front of us at a young age – who else was encouraged to have a “clean plate” as a kid? But fasting can help turn on those longevity genes.

#3. Third is the obvious: High Intensity Interval Training (what we call “HIIT” workouts). In these moments of extreme physical stress and mental toughness, the body becomes hypoxic, which is another word for “lacking oxygen.” When you’re out of breath, your blood is flowing, nourishing your body, and those longevity genes are turned on. We need to be in survival mode to fight back against aging, but the truth is, we spend our whole lives trying to reduce adversity. It’s ironic that a passive, comfortable life actually reduces our lifespan, but it’s true. Get out there and break a sweat.

#4. Fourth is the type of food you eat. Dr. David Sinclair recommends eating plant-based foods, and also healthy amounts of monounsaturated fats – like olive oil and avocados. These fatty acids are great for your body and some contain polyphenols, which are molecules that plants make when they’re stressed. Eating “stressed food” actually activates those longevity genes. Red wine is another example – It’s full of polyphenols and one in particular called “resveratrol” that Dr. Sinclair and his team have been studying for 20 years. It activates those longevity pathways really well.

#5. And lastly, get a good night’s sleep. The body has to restore itself overnight, and if you skip sleep, you are pushing yourself closer and closer into old age. Take a nap every once and while. It’s amazing what it will do for your health.

So there you have it: 5 simple things you can do to live longer. Dr. David Sinclair says that doing those things will at least get you an extra 14 years on average. It’s just living a good life."

Sasha Digiulian first began climbing at 6 years old, in 1998. She has won the World Championships for Female Overall and has placed Silver in the Bouldering World Championships, as well as Bronze in the Duel. Sasha has been the undefeated Panamerican Champion 2004 to the present, and she is a three-time US National Champion.

Outdoors, Sasha is the first North American woman to climb the grade 9a, 5.14d, recognized as one of the hardest sport climbs achieved by a female. She has done two. Sasha was the third woman in the world to accomplish this grade. Additionally, she has onsighted multiple 8b+’s, 5.14a’s, ascended groundbreaking multi-pitch routes of up to 1000 feet of 8c climbing, and has accomplished multiple First Ascents and 28 First Female Ascents around the world, including a First Female Ascent on the North Face of the Eiger.

Sasha has learned to trust the process and the universe in order to quiet her anxiety.

She says that the only way to get up a mountain is to think positively. She’ll find herself saying, “Just go, just go, just go” when she’s in a tough spot.

So get ready to learn how to have the mindset of a champion risk-taker on Episode 731.

Through this journey, I’ve become aware of the things that have been holding me back as a human being, not just as a man, but as a human, in terms of being resentful, guarded, frustrated and defensive. But I recognize men and women might wonder, \"What’s in this book specifically for me?\"

WHAT’S IN IT FOR MEN?

Men will:

Understand what holds you back from your most powerful self
Develop an unwavering foundation of confidence in any situation
Propel you to a level of power and success that you may have never thought possible
Embrace and let go of any fears that hold you back from your dreams
Let go of all pressure, stress, and anxiety, so you can finally feel free
Experience more joy, happiness, and love in all of your relationships
WHAT’S IN IT FOR WOMEN?

Women will:

Understand the men in your life better
Learn ways you can emotionally support the men you love
Learn powerful tools to connect more intimately in your relationships
Learn how to get men you love to open up and be more vulnerable
Understand what holds the men in your life back
Understand why men act guarded, and how to help them open up
IT’S TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY.

It’s that time a year where a lot of us commit to making changes in our lives. But sticking with resolutions is hard. Very few of us are consistently committed to ourselves.

It is not easy.

We have to think of new habits like a roller coaster. We’re building momentum to making the change. But then the roller coaster goes down. The dip is normal.

When you’re feeling low, you have to know that you will climb back up. You have the forward motion to make it happen. To talk about this journey of transformation, I wanted to share a special presentation and Q+A from this year’s Summit of Greatness with an inspirational icon: Shaun T.

Marisa Peer was listed in Tatler’s Guide to Britain’s 250 Best Practitioners and was the only woman on the Men’s Health’s list “Best of British.” She has spent 25+ years working with an extensive client list, including royalty, rock stars, actors, professionals, Olympic athletes, CEOs, and media personalities. She has developed her own style that is frequently referred to as “life-changing.”

Marisa also studied hypnotherapy at the Hypnotism Training Institute of Los Angeles, known as the best hypnotherapy training establishment in the world. She developed her own brand of treatment, Rapid Transformational Therapy, which is a combination of hypnosis, neuro-linguistic programming, and cognitive behavioral therapy. By guiding her patients into a state of relaxation and hypnosis, Marisa Peer is better able to find the root of psychological distress and provide suggestions in order to heal that distress. 

Marisa Peer also started the radical #iamenough movement. By just saying those three words repeatedly — “I am enough” — you can change your brain’s thought patterns and come to a place of self-love.  

Marisa is the bestselling author of several books, including I Am Enough: Mark Your Mirror and Change Your Life, and makes frequent appearances on TV and radio. She’s helped thousands of people overcome a variety of issues, and is motivated to train others to do the same. Marisa Peer joined me on The School of Greatness back on Episode 695, and it definitely has been one of my most popular episodes to date! I was honored to have Marisa Peer return and speak again about the power of positivity in achieving our goals.

Danica Patrick, driver of the No. 10 Aspen Dental Ford Fusion for Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR) in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, joined the mainstream ranks by going against the current, immersing herself and succeeding in the male-dominated world of professional motorsports.

Patrick burst onto the scene in May 2005 when she stunned the world by leading 19 laps and finishing fourth in her first Indianapolis 500, becoming the first woman to lead laps and score a top-five finish in the historic race. One week later, she graced the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first Indy car driver to be featured on the front page in 20 years.

After suffering depression and surviving a car accident at the age of 19, Brendon faced what he felt were life’s last questions: “Did I live fully? Did I love openly? Did I make a difference?” His intention to be happy with the answers led to his own personal breakthroughs, and ultimately to his life’s purpose of helping others live, love and matter. He spent his 20s researching psychology and leadership, and consulting at Accenture. By age 32, he had struck out on his own and became a #1 best-selling author, an in-demand high performance coach, a sought-after speaker, and an early pioneer in the online education space. 

Today, Brendon is widely considered the world’s leading high performance coach (according to both Success Magazine and Oprah.com). He is also one of the most-watched, quoted and followed personal development trainers in history. He is a Top 100 Most Followed Public Figure on Facebook and his videos have been viewed more than 100 million times. More than 2,000,000 students have completed his online courses and video series. For these results, Oprah.com named him “one of the most successful online trainers in history.”

Jay Shetty is an award-winning host, storyteller, Internet personality, and viral content creator. Since launching his video channel in 2016, Jay’s viral wisdom videos have garnered over 7 billion views and gained over 35 million followers globally. He is one of the most viewed people on the internet internationally.

After meeting a monk when he was 18, Jay started redefining success for himself. He wanted a life of service, impact, and passion as opposed to money, fame, and power. After graduating with a 1st class BSc (Hons) Degree, Jay went to live as a monk across India and Europe at age 22. He traded his suits for robes, shaved his head, and lived out of a gym locker for 3 years. After his monk experience, Jay moved back to London with no money to his name but started speaking at business schools about stress and pressure.

His career launched as a coach, and he was invited by Arianna Huffington to be the Host of HuffPost Lifestyle in New York City. He now works with companies like Google, L’Oreal, Facebook, Coca Cola, and Microsoft.

In his inspiring and empowering new book Think Like a Monk, Jay draws on his time as a monk in the Hindu tradition to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power. Drawing on ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits to access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. How to Think Like a Monk is available for preorder and will be released on September 8th, 2020.

I had Jay on the podcast back on Episode 608, where he first shared his monk experience with you all, and today, he talks about training our minds to understand what we desire, who we are, what our purpose is.

Jay is an incredible guy, and I loved having him back on the podcast! He truly wants to help people around the world from what he’s learned, and his positive attitude is contagious.

Join me on Episode 953 to learn how to train your mind to find peace and purpose with ex-monk Jay Shetty!" "UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA" "Lewis Howes" "132318" "3977" "66" "0" "323" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS3QuVaIIo0"

My guest today takes a more nuanced view of things, but she agrees that what you put into your body is foundational to your well-being, and there is no happiness without health.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick has a Ph.D. in biomedical science and has done extensive research on nutrition, aging, stress, and cancer. She trained as a postdoctoral fellow at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute and has investigated the effects of micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) inadequacies on metabolism, inflammation, DNA damage, and aging and whether supplementation can reverse the damage. In addition, she also investigated the role of vitamin D in brain function, behavior, and other physiological functions.

Dr. Patrick frequently engages the public on topics including the role micronutrient deficiencies play in diseases of aging and the benefits of exposing the body to hormetic stressors, such as through exercise, fasting, sauna use or heat stress, or various forms of cold exposure. It is Dr. Patrick’s goal to challenge the status quo and encourage the wider public to think about health and longevity using a proactive, preventative approach.

I had the pleasure of finally sitting down with Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and she’s honestly one of the smartest people I have ever interviewed. We covered so much ground in our conversation, and she finds a relatable way to explain important science that can change your life. Knowledge is power, and I now feel much more well-equipped to make choices about what I eat and how I live.

As an addiction psychiatrist and internationally known expert in mindfulness training for treating addictions, Dr. Jud has developed and tested novel mindfulness programs for habit change, including both in-person and app-based treatments for smoking, emotional eating, and anxiety. In 2012, Dr. Jud gave a TED talk about a simple way to break a bad habit, and in 2017, he wrote a book on the subject called The Craving Mind.

In times like these, mental habits are easy to form. There is a lot of scary headlines and false information out there right now, and when fear sets in, we often try to medicate it with bad habits.

So join me on Episode 930 and listen to what Dr. Jud has to say about the coronavirus and how to keep our minds from spiraling into fear and anxiety.

I wanted to record a solo round on this topic because it’s one of the most powerful tools I’ve ever used to shift my life — it’s called creating a personal advisory board. If you haven’t heard of it before, a personal advisory board is a group of people that you build around you to give you wisdom, inspire you, and, most importantly, create accountability.

You may be wondering what the difference is between an advisor and a mentor — the truth is there is a big difference.

A mentor is someone you look up to. You may know them, but you may not. Chances are, today, any mentor you have can answer your questions through resources they’ve created. Maybe it’s a book, a podcast, or online articles. Board members are people you know much more intimately. It’s also important they have an invested interest in your success.

Ultimately, they have skin in the game when it comes to you. But it goes beyond that. An advisory board can help you in all aspects of your life. It’s a team for success and they are there to call on throughout the year and see your goals through to the end.

No matter where you are at in your life and business, you need an advisory board. Without it, you’re either going to stay stagnant or move toward your dreams much slower than you could with it.

Learn all about my tips on building the ultimate advisory board, on Episode 661.

These two sisters are a true inspiration to the next generation of women. They are the definition of girl power and show that anyone can achieve greatness in anything they want.

If you haven’t heard of the Bella Twins, they are WWE Superstars, Reality TV stars, and fashion designers. I felt so fortunate to sit down with them and have them tell me everything they know about greatness, which is a lot. So much, in fact, that this interview went longer than most episodes. I couldn’t stop, and I know you’ll love every moment of this one. Nikki and Brie told me how they went from small town farm girls to superstars. They talk about the adversity they went through, struggling in a toxic home environment, and even Brie losing her high school sweetheart to a drunk driver.

It's crazy to think that a little idea to launch a podcast and write a book could create such an incredible community. This wouldn't be possible without you. Two years ago, this was just an idea. I said \"I think I want to do an event and bring people together.\" I get these stories and messages from all of you from all over the world, sharing how the message of the podcast, and the people we bring on are impacting your life. It's supporting you. The stories I hear bring me to tears. It's so powerful to hear what you do and what you create in the world. And I'm just trying to facilitate the message by bringing in inspiring and talented, people who lift me up to help me continue to grow. I'm just trying to be a facilitator. You guys are the ones who are building the movement. It's incredible how much this has spread from just an idea.

Warning - important message, please read carefully:
The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practiced in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced.
Never practice the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went to far. Take a step back next time.
The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practiced responsible, there is a risk of hypothermia.
Do not practice the method during pregnancy or when having epilepsy. Persons with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting with the Wim Hof Method.

Thank you for watching this powerful interview with Dean Graziosi!
Check out the show notes here: https://www.lewishowes.com/917

Dean Graziosi is an entrepreneur, marketer, success coach, business owner, real estate investor, and a leading trainer throughout the world. For nearly 15 years, he has appeared daily on American TV and is highly respected as a top businessman, entrepreneur, multiple New York Times bestselling author, and inspirational speaker.

His best-selling book, Millionaire Success Habits: The Gateway to Wealth and Prosperity, has amassed over 1,000,000 copies sold. He’s also hosting a free webinar training with Tony Robbins on February 27th, 2020 for anyone who wants to learn how they can be successful in the exploding digital economy. 

Dean wasn’t born into this success, though. His parents divorced when he was 3, and so he lived with his grandmother, who raised him on a tight budget. He went to high school, but never went to college, and began his career by fixing and selling used cars. He later made his way into real estate and developed a unique “core” approach to success in his first book, Totally Fulfilled. Today, he’s one of the top entrepreneurs in the nation. 

If you’re wanting to become an entrepreneur or you’re already one, Dean has some great wisdom when it comes to mastering your money. We all want to be paid for something that we’re good at and that we enjoy doing.

Join me on Episode 917 to learn how to get there with Dean Graziosi.

It's crazy to think that a little idea to launch a podcast and write a book could create such an incredible community. This wouldn't be possible without you. Two years ago, this was just an idea. I said \"I think I want to do an event and bring people together.\" I get these stories and messages from all of you from all over the world, sharing how the message of the podcast, and the people we bring on are impacting your life. It's supporting you. The stories I hear bring me to tears. It's so powerful to hear what you do and what you create in the world. And I'm just trying to facilitate the message by bringing in inspiring and talented, people who lift me up to help me continue to grow. I'm just trying to be a facilitator. You guys are the ones who are building the movement. It's incredible how much this has spread from just an idea. If you haven't gotten your tickets yet for the Summit of Greatness, prices go up next Friday, so make sure everyone in your group has their ticket. Summitofgreatness.com

Dr. Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and the author of the million-plus selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Jan 2018, Penguin Books), which has been a Number 1 bestseller in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Brazil, and which is now slated to be translated into 40 languages. His now-classic book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (just released as an audiobook) offers a revolutionary take on the psychology of religion, and the hundred or more scientific papers he published with his colleagues and students have substantively advanced the modern understanding of creativity and personality. He is is regarded by his current University of Toronto students as one of three truly life-changing professors, and was nominated for the prestigious Levinson Teaching Prize as a Harvard professor. His classroom lectures on mythology and the psychology of religion, based on Maps of Meaning, were turned into a popular 13-part TV series on TVO.

As you know, it’s important to continually grow (especially if you’re an entrepreneur). I’m not excluded from that. Ten years ago I read a book by Gary Vaynerchuk that changed the course of my life.

On this episode of the School of Greatness, Gary returns to the show for his third time. He gives me advice for my next ten years but also gives you invaluable advice on so many topics that you won’t hear anywhere else.

Gary is known for his unapologetic truth-telling attitude. He says a lot of things on social media that people may feel are harsh or extreme. But when we were talking, Gary revealed he actually cares deeply about what people think about him. And that’s why he’s so committed to serving people with hard-earned business wisdom in the long run.

He explains why teenage nerds are winning right now, how hitting the big lists isn’t what matters in business, and why you need an independent person in a romantic relationship.

Wim Hof aka \"The Iceman\" is an absolute legend in the world of endurance sports, science, health, and mindfulness.

I’ve been hearing about his absolutely incredible records of being outside in the extreme cold for years (he currently holds 26 world records).

But it wasn’t until he came by the studio for an interview that I got to experience the full wisdom and impact of Wim.

First, he put me through an intense and powerful breathing exercise that released all the stress from my body and mind.

Then, shortly after the interview started, he put me through another one.

We got deep into the science of what Wim has discovered through his own experimentation with pushing his body and mind physically.

Show notes: http://lewishowes.com/189
-----
Matthew Hussey is a sought-after dating coach and NYT best-selling author who is a breath of fresh air in the dating advice scene.

Matt and I met a couple years ago around a TV show that he was a matchmaker on and I was impressed not only by his dating savvy but by his business savvy as well. He is now a regular on the Today Show and hosts live events that close to 100,000 women have attended. And his YouTube videos where he gives dating advice are amazing (I watch them myself).

He came by my studio and we had an awesome conversation (which could have gone on for hours) about the best ways to actually meet someone you are interested in. He also gave great advice about keeping the desire in your existing relationship. Beyond his tips, however, Matt dove into the other reasons we struggle to meet the partner of our dreams – and it has a lot to do with entitlement.

I loved this conversation and can’t wait to have Matt back on the show.No matter where you are in your love life, prepare to get expert coaching from Matthew Hussey in Episode 189.

I put all of this negative and lonely energy into my dream of being a professional athlete, and one day, an Olympian. I went on to play Arena Football for one season, but a career ending injury shattered my identity. I didn’t know who I was without sports.

Would anyone still want to hang out with me?
Would anyone respect me?
How will I make money?
Who am I?
What will I do for the rest of my life now???
Broken, broke, and clueless on how to make money or get a career, my obsession for learning about business, marketing, product design, human behavior, and adding value to people (when I had no value to give) began.

Since then it’s been a powerful journey for me – becoming a New York Times bestselling author, building up a multi-million dollar online media company,  speaking all over the world, advising for billion dollar brands, receiving media praise from places like Details Magazine, being one of “5 Internet Gurus Who Can Make You Rich” and much more. I’m a firm believer that living in a beautiful state, the journey you experience, and the lives you impact is more important than what you do or what you have accumulated. I got a taste of being a pro athlete for a short amount of time. And I realized early on that when I commit to my vision and pursue it with 100% passion… anything is possible. Living my ideal lifestyle is far more important to me than working on something I don’t fully love just to survive life and then die.

It’s hard to think that without having any business experience I could go from sleeping on my sister’s couch to running a seven figure business in a couple years. Now I’m committed to impacting 100 million lives. I teach people how to pursue the dream that burns inside them and how to earn a full time income while making an impact on the world and others.

I do this through my podcast, videos, books, online courses, live events, experiential workshops and one on one interactions. I’m so grateful where life has taken me and the life that I’ve chosen to design on a daily basis. I believe we are the authors of our own life, and I’m blessed for the adversity I’ve faced. It makes me appreciate my life now and have compassion for others who suffer in a much bigger way. I’m often asked to mentor others, and the way I do this is through my podcast so I can maximize my time and impact more people. If you have a question, I’ve probably answered it on one of my episodes.

Please say hi over on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube or Twitter as I love to hear what each episode is bringing up for you and the lessons you are learning.

Always remember you were born for a reason, a purpose and something bigger than yourself. But YOU have to activate this calling; no one is going to turn it on for you! It’s Your Responsibility to build yourself into the person who can live a great life. No one is going to give you the power to develop your mental strength, emotional intelligence and physical health to have the life you want. That’s between you and you!

I know there are times that are challenging, and it may seem like you can’t get out of it. I’m living proof that you can. If a small town boy from Ohio (who didn’t see any potential for his future) can do it, then so can you!

Your dreams matter because YOU Matter! Never forget that, but you must learn the wisdom, skills and tools to write your own story. Be the hero you were born to be. Start the journey with me because the world needs you my friend!

You are love.

In short, this is for any entrepreneur who wants to grow into becoming the #1 trusted authority in your industry, stand out from the rest, and make a massive impact on your community and the world.

People come to me for coaching for many different reasons...
Some have hundreds of thousands of followers but they aren't bringing in the income they want. Others have all the authority and expertise in the world but have yet to harness their ideas into the programs and courses that will make them financially free.

Still, others have amazing programs and offer but no audience ready to buy them. Some are stuck at the 6 figure level, not sure how to break through to the next level of profit

What most people need is the right coach, accountability from a group of high-level performers who they trust, and the tools and proven information that will get them to the goal they desire.

Since space is very limited, we're accepting participants on a first come, first served basis. You must meet the criteria above to apply and you will get a response if we feel are the right fit for the group

I’ve recorded well over six hundred episodes at this point. There’s been so much knowledge and wisdom from the brightest minds on the planet shared on the show.  I know it can be overwhelming to try to take it all, so I’m bringing you a recap of some of the strongest wisdom I’ve received over the years of doing this podcast.

For this episode I wanted to concentrate of high performance habits that I’ve learned from such amazing people as Brendon Burchard, Michael Gervais, Tony Robbins, and Mel Robbins.
Each of these guests has reached the top of their game, and the biggest factor in that has been their habits.

They set their mind to achieve something big and found a way to persevere even at some of the worst times. So what makes them different than you?

Nothing.

They aren’t super human and they aren’t luckier than you. If you take their words of wisdom, you’ll find how to overcome what’s holding you back. I hope you enjoy these nuggets of information I hand selected so you don’t have to dig for them.

Amanda Nguyen is the founder and CEO of Rise, a non-governmental civil rights organization. She was the power behind the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Rights Act, one of 23 bills to pass unanimously through US Congress. She was in Forbes’ 2017 “30 Under 30” Law & Policy list and was an invited speaker at the 2017 Women’s March on Washington. In 2018, California representatives Mimi Walters and Zoe Lofgren nominated Nguyen for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.

Amanda was raped in college and soon after learned of the injustices surrounding sexual assault survivors. Instead of getting angry, she made a change.

So get ready to learn how you can make a difference by taking political action on Episode 788.

Through this journey, I’ve become aware of the things that have been holding me back as a human being, not just as a man, but as a human, in terms of being resentful, guarded, frustrated and defensive. But I recognize men and women might wonder, \"What’s in this book specifically for me?\"

WHAT’S IN IT FOR MEN?

Men will:

Understand what holds you back from your most powerful self
Develop an unwavering foundation of confidence in any situation
Propel you to a level of power and success that you may have never thought possible
Embrace and let go of any fears that hold you back from your dreams
Let go of all pressure, stress, and anxiety, so you can finally feel free
Experience more joy, happiness, and love in all of your relationships
WHAT’S IN IT FOR WOMEN?

Women will:
Understand the men in your life better
Learn ways you can emotionally support the men you love
Learn powerful tools to connect more intimately in your relationships
Learn how to get men you love to open up and be more vulnerable
Understand what holds the men in your life back
Understand why men act guarded, and how to help them open up
IT’S TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY.

Check out the show notes here: https://www.lewishowes.com/898

Dhar Mann is a serial entrepreneur who has experienced the highs and lows of success. From funding millions of dollars in real estate loans at 19 to his time in the medical marijuana industry, to scaling an eight-figure cosmetics business, he has a proven ability to build companies. Most recently he has become the fastest-growing viral video creator in less than one year with over 3 billion views across Facebook, IGTV, and YouTube.

Recently, I became friends with Dhar in real life and was blown away by his story of shallow success, failure, rock bottom, reinvention, and true success today.

After disappearing from social media for 4 years, losing everything, including his reputation, and getting into legal trouble, Dhar has reappeared as a new man. I loved hearing him tell his full story, for the first time publicly, and the wisdom he has learned from losing everything to building it back the right way. I’m excited for you to hear this story yourself in Episode 898 with Dhar Mann

Through this journey, I’ve become aware of the things that have been holding me back as a human being, not just as a man, but as a human, in terms of being resentful, guarded, frustrated and defensive. But I recognize men and women might wonder, \"What’s in this book specifically for me?\"

WHAT’S IN IT FOR MEN?

Men will:

Understand what holds you back from your most powerful self
Develop an unwavering foundation of confidence in any situation
Propel you to a level of power and success that you may have never thought possible
Embrace and let go of any fears that hold you back from your dreams
Let go of all pressure, stress, and anxiety, so you can finally feel free
Experience more joy, happiness, and love in all of your relationships
WHAT’S IN IT FOR WOMEN?

Women will:

Understand the men in your life better
Learn ways you can emotionally support the men you love
Learn powerful tools to connect more intimately in your relationships
Learn how to get men you love to open up and be more vulnerable
Understand what holds the men in your life back
Understand why men act guarded, and how to help them open up
IT’S TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY.

An activist and thought leader, Glennon is the founder and president of Together Rising, an all-women led nonprofit organization that has revolutionized grassroots philanthropy – raising over $25 million for women, families, and children in crisis. Glennon Doyle is the author of #1 New York Times bestsellers Untamed (a Reese’s Book Club selection) and Love Warrior (an Oprah’s Book Club selection), as well as the New York Times bestseller Carry On, Warrior. Glennon lives in Florida with her wife and three children.

Her newest memoir, Untamed, came out on March 10, 2020, and explores the joy and peace we discover when we stop striving to meet others’ expectations and start trusting the voice deep within us. People everywhere are raving about how this book has changed their lives and helped them stand for who they are and not what the world wants them to be. 

Glennon has been an outstanding friend to me and has helped me walked through some difficult places. She encouraged me to share my story about being sexually assaulted as a kid, and I am so grateful for her courageous spirit.

Dr. Mark Hyman, M.D. is the founder and medical director of the UltraWellness Center, Director of the Cleveland Clinical Center for Functional Medicine, and the Chairman of the Board of the Institute for Functional Medicine.

I’ve been hearing about his absolutely incredible records of being outside in the extreme cold for years (he currently holds 26 world records).

But it wasn’t until he came by the studio for an interview that I got to experience the full wisdom and impact of Wim.

First, he put me through an intense and powerful breathing exercise that released all the stress from my body and mind.

Then, shortly after the interview started, he put me through another one.

We got deep into the science of what Wim has discovered through his own experimentation with pushing his body and mind physically.

If you know anything about Ben Shapiro, you probably know that he ruffles a lot of feathers. Ben Shapiro is editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire and host of The Ben Shapiro Show, the top conservative podcast in the nation. Ben is the New York Times bestselling author of seven nonfiction books, including his most recent book, The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great. Ben is constantly featured on major newspapers and websites and is widely regarded as one of the best debaters of our time. 

Ben believes that people need to look within when they have a problem. He’s more interested in root values than debating specific issues.

Ben and I don’t agree on everything politically, but that shouldn’t stop us having a conversation. In this interview, I was more interested in learning about Ben’s personal life, about what makes him tick, and about his debate strategies rather than his political opinions. 

A lot of people either love Ben Shapiro or hate him. When I posted this episode, some of you might have unsubscribed. But the way I look at it is, even if you disagree with someone on something, there is usually something you can learn from them! And there’s probably something they can learn from you! 

Dr. Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and the author of the million-plus selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Jan 2018, Penguin Books), which has been a Number 1 bestseller in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Brazil, and which is now slated to be translated into 40 languages.

He has become super popular in the last two years for his lectures which he records and puts on YouTube.

I had such an interesting interview with him that had so much important information, I actually split it into two episodes.

In this episode of The School of Greatness, we sit down and discuss why we admire sports figures, how any aim (even a bad one) is crucial for you to feel fulfilled, and a mindset tool you can use to motivate you to do hard things."

His seven best-selling books have sold more than 11 million copies combined.

By age 26 he had established a $4 million real estate portfolio, only to lose it by age 30. Using the wisdom he gained, Ramsey rebuilt his financial life and now teaches others how to be responsible with their money, so they can acquire enough wealth to take care of loved ones, retire with dignity, and give generously to others. In 1992, he started a business (now called Ramsey Solutions) to help people everywhere use their money profitably and wisely.  Ramsey runs a multi-million-dollar company with a nationally recognized brand, but he defines success by the number of lives changed through his message of hope.

Dave Ramsey’s iconic radio program, The Dave Ramsey Show, is heard on more than 500 radio stations throughout the United States and Canada. Dave is also the creator of Financial Peace University (FPU), a program that helps people dump their debt, take control of their money, and learn new behaviors around money that are founded on commitment and accountability.

COVID-19 has not only affected our health but our finances as well. You might be out of a job. You may have lost a ton of money in stocks. Maybe money has always been tight, and you’re scrambling to make ends meet. Don’t let yourself be caught up in fear. There is always hope — even when you hit rock bottom. Don’t make financial decisions based on fear and desperation.

Check out the show notes here: https://www.lewishowes.com/910

If anyone has mastered their mind, it’s extreme athlete Wim Hof. Wim Hof got his nickname “The Iceman” by breaking a number of records related to cold exposure. His feats include climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in shorts, running a half marathon above the Arctic Circle on his bare feet, and standing in a container while covered with ice cubes for more than 112 minutes. He developed the Wim Hof Method: a natural path to an optimal state of body and mind.

He says that our brains have the power to guarantee us happiness, strength, and health. We can actually regulate our mind and the autonomous nervous system by breathing and being present. I  had the incredible opportunity to travel to Poland along with several other top entrepreneurs and business owners to experience a week with Wim Hof that I will never forget.

As a group, we participated in several different exercises. Some involved meditation and breathing and others involved enduring intense cold and ice water challenges. On this trip, we all learned about the importance of brotherhood. Some of the physical challenges would have been unbearable if we were going at it alone. We all had each other to encourage, to motivate, and to push.

We’ve all been in a place, where we think, “I can’t do this anymore.” That’s a mindset roadblock that we were taught to overcome. Often in the midst of being uncomfortable, our minds and bodies panic. Our top priority is becoming comfortable again. But this is not often the correct way to deal with stress or pain.

The mind is powerful, and if you teach it to avoid pain, then you’ll never reach your full potential. If anyone has mastered the art of being uncomfortable while releasing stress, it’s Wim Hof. He gave all of us an experience we will never forget.

She released her first album, JoJo, in June 2004, and the album’s first single, “Leave (Get Out),” was No.1 on the US Billboard Pop Chart. She was only 13 years old – the youngest solo artist in history to ever top the Billboard charts. She’s also starred in movies like Aquamarine and RV (with Robin Williams) and in TV shows like Hawaii 5-0 and Lethal Weapon. 

In 2006, she released her second studio album, The High Road, which was also a great success, but her third album, Mad Love, was delayed due to record label disputes. She realized she didn’t have power over her own voice, and this was non-negotiable. 

In 2008, JoJo founded her own record label, Clover Music, and re-released her previous albums. Her fourth studio album, good to know, will drop in spring 2020, and in April she will kick off an international tour.

JoJo was offered her first record deal at six years old. From a young age, she has felt immense pressure from the music industry to become who they want her to be, but JoJo made a stand for herself.

Join me on Episode 919 with JoJo to learn how she owned her story and how you can too.

Chase Jarvis is an American artist, director, entrepreneur and author who co-founded the on-line educational platform Creative Live. Chase consistently uses his voice to educate and inspire people to achieve their creative potential.

 As a child, Chase Jarvis loved being creative and started making his own films, but after overhearing his teacher tell his parents “Chase is so much better at sports than arts”, he lost his creative passion and replaced it with a need to achieve athletically. In the following years he became a standout athlete in multiple sports, but his grandfather’s death reignited his creative spirit and since that time he has lived a creative life putting his creative spirit into everything he does. Now, his mission is to help people tap into their creative potential. So, get ready to learn how to unleash your creativity on Episode 853.

There is so much unknown, so much fear and panic, that it can get really overwhelming — my girlfriend literally made herself sick the other night watching the news.

Instead of panicking, we should be focusing on what we can do to prevent the virus from spreading and how we can best respond to the chaos around us.

I’ve got my best friend Matthew Cesaratto in the house, and today we have a coffeehouse conversation about the coronavirus, how we should respond, and how we can all be leaders in a time of fear and crisis.

Matt begins the episode by talking about some practical ways to keep the virus from spreading (wash your hands, disinfect surfaces, increase air ventilation, etc.) All this information comes straight from the CDC website, which is a great resource you can use to educate yourself about the virus rather than just media or news outlets.

Then, I give 8 things that we should do in order to stay calm and be leaders in a time of chaos

Rich Roll has been on my show twice before, and it was a pleasure having him back. He battled with an alcohol addiction that ruined his life from the age of 17 to the age of 31, where he went to a treatment center. Most people only spend 28 days there. He ended up spending over 100. When he got out, he changed his life. He pursued a career most people would consider ideal, and made a great living. The problem was, it wasn’t the life he wanted and it took a toll on him physically. After having a brush with death in his late 30s, he began living his life for him. Since then, he’s become a successful athlete, motivational speaker, podcast host, and all around incredible human being.

Sam Harris is a New York Times best-selling author, podcast host, and creator of the Waking Up Course.

The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. His writing and public lectures cover a wide range of topics—neuroscience, moral philosophy, religion, meditation practice, human violence, rationality—but generally focus on how a growing understanding of ourselves and the world is changing our sense of how we should live.

Sam shares that when he experiences emotions like anger to sadness, he becomes interested in the emotion. He observes his body’s reaction and tries to distance himself from his feelings. So get ready to learn how mindfulness can end suffering on Episode 824.

Most of the comments on this interview are mixed, some love it and others hate it.  For those that aren't seeing value and find this off putting- know that I do my best in every interview to get people to open up and revel their stories and lessons of how they achieved what they created in their life.  I've never had someone not open up this much so it was challenging for me but this was all on the topic of masculinity and how money affects us as men.  There are some interesting lessons in here and I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you learned based on this in the comments below.

His most famous creation is the “Mega Ram Runner,” and you should check it out — it’s totally badass. 

Dave went to college to study welding, mechanics, and fabrication, but after his first semester, he decided that he could learn more from real-world experience than from books and lectures. He worked for his uncle’s construction business and handled heavy machinery while learning the ins and outs of running a business.

In 2009, Dave met the girl of his dreams. One year later, they were married, and he opened a small used car lot. Then he began to build his dream company, DieselSellerz, which builds badass trucks. That childhood dream of his really came to fruition. 

But Dave didn’t accomplish all this by being comfortable. He had to take risks and stretch himself in order to make things work. He took the responsibility of achieving success upon himself and didn’t expect it to be handed to him.

In this interview, we talk about how he achieved that success, focused on self-improvement, and invested in healthy relationships. So buckle up and get ready for Episode 923 with the incredible Dave Sparks.

As a lecturer and educator, he is driven by the conviction that each of us has the potential for greatness and unlimited abilities.

In his easy-to-understand, compassionate style, he has educated thousands of people, detailing how they can rewire their brains and recondition their bodies to make lasting changes. His most recent book, Becoming Supernatural, talks about how we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical, transcendental experiences and develop a more healthy body, mind, and spiritual life. If you want to learn more, also check out his guided meditation CDs and audio downloads!

I’ve had Dr. Joe on The School of Greatness a few times now, and he’s always been a hit. If you haven’t already, check out our past interviews (Episode 933, Episode 826, and Episode 679) — they are all really applicable to what we are going through right now with COVID-19.

If you’re carrying around your past as a burden, I want to encourage you — there is healing. There is hope. Your past does not define you or your body’s health. You can reach a higher level of consciousness and embrace the healing your heart deserves."

Full Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQzSWEMeLLg

Bethany is a professional surfer, author, and motivational speaker. At the age of 13, Bethany lost her left arm to a 14-foot tiger shark, which seemed to end her dream career as a surfer. However, one month after the attack, Bethany returned to surfing and within two years had won her first national surfing title. Bethany’s foundation of faith has been her backbone; her source of truth, hope, and strength. At 17 years old, she realized her dream of surfing professionally, and she is still an active surf competitor to this day.

Bethany talks about her journey to become a mother and what it’s taught her. She also reveals the lessons her parents taught her that allowed her to get back on the board after losing her arm.

She evolved her more traditional training from Cornell University and The New School to one that acknowledges the connection between the mind and body. Dr. LePera founded the Mindful Healing Center in Center City Philadelphia where she works with individuals, couples, and families. She takes gut health, sleep, movement, cellular health, belief, and mindfulness into treatment.

Dr. LePera views mental and physical struggles from a whole-person perspective and works to identify the underlying physical and emotional causes of pain. She understands that balance is an integral part of wellness, and she empowers individuals to heal themselves, supporting them on their wellness journeys.

On May 1st, her new healing community SelfHealers Circle will launch and provide teaching, resources, and challenges to help people on their journey to healing. It will be a private community of self-healers (away from the public eye of Instagram) who are here to support and hold each other accountable for their journeys. In addition, Dr. LePera will give a monthly Q&A session, lead meditations, provide workshops, and host special guests.

Often times, creating boundaries is a central factor in maintaining balance within our lives. Having relationships is vital to mental and emotional health, but if we are constantly letting people control us, then the balance is impossible. In the worst cases, these types of relationships can cause some level of trauma which continues to affect a person throughout their life. Sometimes, in order to stay healthy, we have to say “no” to people without apologizing.

Are you struggling to create boundaries in your own relationships? Do you feel weighed down by trauma? Do you want to learn how to self-heal?

Join me on Episode 932 to learn how to set healthy boundaries in your relationships, how to find peace within yourself, and how to live a more balanced life with the Holistic Psychologist, Dr. Nicole LePera.

This is audio podcast number #535 with Maria Sharapova

http://www.mariasharapova.com/unstoppable-tour/
http://www.mariasharapova.com/
https://www.instagram.com/mariasharapova/

Maria Sharapova was born on April 19, 1987, in Nyagan, Russia. She started playing tennis at an early age and turned professional at the age of 14. In 2007, a shoulder injury sidelined Sharapova and contributed to a series of losses, but she was still ranked among the top 5 women’s tennis players at the end of that year. Her shoulder injury continued to plague her game, sidelining her in 2008. In 2009, Sharapova had surgery to repair the injury and after a year of rehabilitation and a string of losses, she started to make a comeback in 2011 when she finished the year ranked 4, her first top 5 finish since 2007.
In June 2012, Sharapova defeated Sara Errani in the women’s French Open, becoming the 10th woman to complete a career Grand Slam, winning all four major tennis tournaments.
At the 2012 Summer Olympic Games—Sharapova’s Olympic debut—she won a silver medal in women’s singles, losing the gold to American tennis star Serena Williams. Sharapova came in second to Williams the following year at the French Open. She lost the singles titles to Williams in the finals. That June, Sharapova made a less-than-impressive showing at Wimbledon. She only made it as far as the second round of competition.

It's crazy to think that a little idea to launch a podcast and write a book could create such an incredible community. This wouldn't be possible without you. Two years ago, this was just an idea. I said \"I think I want to do an event and bring people together.\" I get these stories and messages from all of you from all over the world, sharing how the message of the podcast, and the people we bring on are impacting your life. It's supporting you. The stories I hear bring me to tears. It's so powerful to hear what you do and what you create in the world. And I'm just trying to facilitate the message by bringing in inspiring and talented, people who lift me up to help me continue to grow. I'm just trying to be a facilitator. You guys are the ones who are building the movement. It's incredible how much this has spread from just an idea. If you haven't gotten your tickets yet for the Summit of Greatness, prices go up next Friday, so make sure everyone in your group has their ticket. Summitofgreatness.com

For over a decade at clubs across the country, and as a  podcast host, Glaser has been honing her shockingly-honest, no-holds barred style of comedy. Nikki Glaser has had 3 specials on Netflix, she’s the host of the Comedy Central podcast You Up, and she’s embarking on a mini-tour of all-outside stand-up shows at the end of the month!

In addition to her shows, Nikki has multiple stand-up specials and late-night tv appearances in which she jokes about her most humiliating moments as a woman in the modern world. Nikki’s past and current struggles with anorexia, depression, and anxiety are fair game in both her stand-up and in in-depth interviews like WTF with Marc Maron and JRE with Joe Rogan. Glaser has become a complete open book on mic — and not just for the laughs; she’s also adamant on being the voice for women that she yearned for as a young, confused, adolescent herself.

This was a truly unique School of Greatness conversation. Nikki was hilarious, but also vulnerable, real, and full of relatable stories. We actually sat down back in early spring, before the quarantine, but we thought this was a perfect time to drop the episode. We all could use a little more humor in our lives, so get ready to laugh!

Join me on Episode 995 to learn about self-image, intimacy, and the dangers of comedy with Nikki Glaser!

SOME QUESTIONS I ASK:
How much self-consciousness do you feel in day-to-day life?
What do you look for in relationships?
What was the best joke you ever told?
How do you approach the current climate as a comedian?
IN THIS EPISODE, YOU WILL LEARN:
Why Nikki struggles with her self-image
About Nikki’s up-and-down quest for intimacy
How Nikki approaches her comedy

I’ve learned so much from him through the years by reading his books, watching him give talks, and hearing him speak.

He’s been on the podcast twice already, so of course, when I got the chance to interview him about his newest book, Unshakeable, I jumped on it.

You probably know I don’t read fast and it’s not my favorite way to learn (dyslexia, etc). But I read this book in 4 hours, which has to be a record for me.

“Trade your expectation for appreciation.”
 
I’m really glad I did as well since Tony partnered with the top financial advisor in the country to write a playbook for financial freedom no matter what the market is doing.

In this interview, Tony and I go deep into exactly how to do this, but we also cover powerful topics like how to avoid suffering, the power of choice, and what is still uncomfortable for Tony after all his success in life."

Through this journey, I’ve become aware of the things that have been holding me back as a human being, not just as a man, but as a human, in terms of being resentful, guarded, frustrated and defensive. But I recognize men and women might wonder, \"What’s in this book specifically for me?\"

WHAT’S IN IT FOR MEN?

Men will:

Understand what holds you back from your most powerful self
Develop an unwavering foundation of confidence in any situation
Propel you to a level of power and success that you may have never thought possible
Embrace and let go of any fears that hold you back from your dreams
Let go of all pressure, stress, and anxiety, so you can finally feel free
Experience more joy, happiness, and love in all of your relationships
WHAT’S IN IT FOR WOMEN?

Women will:

Understand the men in your life better
Learn ways you can emotionally support the men you love
Learn powerful tools to connect more intimately in your relationships
Learn how to get men you love to open up and be more vulnerable
Understand what holds the men in your life back
Understand why men act guarded, and how to help them open up
IT’S TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY.

Sian Beilock is a renowned Psychology Professor and the current President of Barnard College, as well as the author of multiple books, including Choke: What the Secrets of the Brain Reveal About Getting It Right When You Have To.

Sian works with educators, business leaders, athletic coaches, and those involved in public policy, including serving on a National Research Council committee on decision-making and stress. She studies the many brain and body factors influencing all types of performance: from test-taking to public speaking to perfecting your golf swing.

I had the pleasure of talking with Sian, and I was blown anyway by her wisdom. I know what it’s like to choke under pressure. We’ve all been there. And while I wish I’d had this conversation years ago, I feel fortunate that I can apply what I learned going forward.

According to Nick, the victory over his struggles, as well as his strength and passion for life today, can be credited to his faith in God. His family, friends and the many people he has encountered along the journey have inspired him to carry on as well.

Since his first speaking engagement at age 19, Nick has traveled around the world, sharing his story with millions, sometimes in stadiums filled to capacity. Nick established Life Without Limbs ministry in 2005, and he is currently serving as President and CEO. In 2012, Nick married the love of his life and now they have four beautiful children.

This is audio podcast number #532 with Ido Portal

Starting from an early age in Traditional Martial Arts Ido was always obsessed with the physical. Later on, at 15 he met the Afro-Brazilian Capoeira, a meeting that sent him on a lifetime journey leading to the realization that he didn't just love Martial Arts or Strength or this or that, but he was actually obsessed with... Movement. That epiphany got him to embark on a journey to study from 'Movement Teachers'. After countless searches, he could not find anyone who HONESTLY could represent that title.

He was assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and deployed as an undercover operative for the U.S. Child Sex Tourism Jump Team.

Tim has worked every type of case imaginable in the fight to dismantle child trafficking rings. Ballard has worked undercover in the United States and in multiple foreign countries to infiltrate child trafficking organizations. In this effort, he has successfully dismantled dozens of these organizations and rescued countless children from sex slavery. He has trained hundreds of law enforcement officers and has testified before the United States Congress on best practices to liberate children from sex slavery.

Tim Ballard is currently the CEO of Operation Underground Railroad, an organization that fights to dismantle child trafficking rings and rescue kids all over the world. Tim’s efforts are now being depicted in a feature film called Sound of Freedom.

This was not an easy conversation, and some of you might find this information disturbing, but it’s so important. To those of you who think this issue may not hit close to home … it does, in more ways than you know.

The film depicts Bryant as a child dreaming of basketball glory and as an N.B.A. star. Bryant said the film was “about the emotional journey of having a dream, believing it’ll come true; it comes true, then the realization that you have to wake up from that dream and move on to another.”

Since launching his video channel in 2016, Jay’s viral wisdom videos have garnered over 7 billion views and gained over 35 million followers globally. He is one of the most viewed people on the internet internationally.

After meeting a monk when he was 18, Jay started redefining success for himself. He wanted a life of service, impact, and passion as opposed to money, fame, and power. After graduating with a 1st class BSc (Hons) Degree, Jay went to live as a monk across India and Europe at age 22. He traded his suits for robes, shaved his head, and lived out of a gym locker for 3 years. After his monk experience, Jay moved back to London with no money to his name but started speaking at business schools about stress and pressure.

His career launched as a coach, and he was invited by Arianna Huffington to be the Host of HuffPost Lifestyle in New York City. He now works with companies like Google, L’Oreal, Facebook, Coca Cola, and Microsoft.

In his inspiring and empowering new book Think Like a Monk, Jay draws on his time as a monk in the Hindu tradition to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power. Drawing on ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits to access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. How to Think Like a Monk is available for preorder and will be released on September 8th, 2020.

I had Jay on the podcast back on Episode 608, where he first shared his monk experience with you all, and today, he talks about training our minds to understand what we desire, who we are, what our purpose is.

Jay is an incredible guy, and I loved having him back on the podcast! He truly wants to help people around the world from what he’s learned, and his positive attitude is contagious." "UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA" "Lewis Howes" "8203" "369" "19" "0" "90" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk-CYlsfwQU"

He is the Founder and CEO of Kwik Learning, an online brain training and learning firm where he teaches people how to get the most out of their minds. Jim suffered a brain injury at the age of five, which led to slow brain performance and left him struggling in school. As the years wore on, he undertook a journey to learn about his brain – why it was “broken” and what he could do to fix it.

That journey led him to discovering different learning habits, including accelerated learning systems and tactics. He spent years training his brain for speed-reading and memory improvement. Companies like SpaceX and Virgin, owned by billionaire geniuses like Richard Branson and Elon Musk, have trained with him. He’s also trained major celebrities and political leaders such as Will Smith, Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and many others.

Jim just released his new book Limitless: Upgrade Your Brain, Learn Anything Faster, and Unlock Your Exceptional Life on April 28th, 2020. As a kid, Jim loved superheroes and comic books inspired him to reach for greatness, even when people told him it was impossible. Over the years, Jim unlocked his greatest superpower – his mind – and you can too."

Dr. Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and the author of the million-plus selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Jan 2018, Penguin Books), which has been a Number 1 bestseller in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Brazil, and which is now slated to be translated into 40 languages. His now-classic book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (just released as an audiobook) offers a revolutionary take on the psychology of religion, and the hundred or more scientific papers he published with his colleagues and students have substantively advanced the modern understanding of creativity and personality. He is regarded by his current University of Toronto students as one of three truly life-changing professors and was nominated for the prestigious Levinson Teaching Prize as a Harvard professor. His classroom lectures on mythology and the psychology of religion, based on Maps of Meaning, were turned into a popular 13-part TV series on TVO.

James did 50 Ironman Triathlons in 50 days, in 50 states. He was constantly on the move for 12 hours a day, running, swimming, and cycling. As soon as he was finished he had to travel to the next state.

Most days James only had about four hours to rest. That’s no time for your body to recover. Did he hurt? Did he want to give up? Of course. But James ended up powering through, breaking a Guinness World Record. At the end of the 50 days, his body had began to accept this was it’s new reality and he felt like he needed to do another triathlon.

Humans can push themselves so much further than you’d think. We just need to get over our mental barriers to see what we can really achieve.

Jim Kwik is an entrepreneur, business coach, and literal genius. He is the Founder and CEO of Kwik Learning, an online brain training and learning firm where he teaches people how to get the most out of their minds. Jim suffered a brain injury at the age of five, which led to slow brain performance and left him struggling in school. As the years wore on, he undertook a journey to learn about his brain – why it was “broken” and what he could do to fix it.

That journey led him to discover different learning habits, including accelerated learning systems and tactics. He spent years training his brain for speed-reading and memory improvement. Companies like SpaceX and Virgin, owned by billionaire geniuses like Richard Branson and Elon Musk, have trained with him. He’s also trained major celebrities and political leaders such as Will Smith, Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and many others.

Jim just released his new book Limitless: Upgrade Your Brain, Learn Anything Faster, and Unlock Your Exceptional Life on April 28th, 2020. As a kid, Jim loved superheroes and comic books inspired him to reach for greatness, even when people told him it was impossible. Over the years, Jim unlocked his greatest superpower – his mind – and you can too.

I had Jim Kwik on The School of Greatness back in the early days, and I was so excited to have him back on the show. Join me on Episode 947 to learn about how your mind can accomplish far more than you’ve ever imagined with the incredible Jim Kwik!

This is audio podcast number #530 with Tim Larkin

As America’s leading Pro-Victim Rights and Personal Safety Advocate Tim Larkin is used to his fair share of controversy. After being named the 2011 Self Defense Instructor of the Year and simultaneously inducted into the Black Belt Hall Of Fame, Mr. Larkin ended the year by taking on the UK Home Secretary and getting banned from the UK for his stand on a citizen’s right to defend themselves from imminent violence. Currently Mr. Larkin is appealing that decision from the UK government and his speaking engagements have never been more pointed and engaging as violent crime rises and economic weakness causes severe cutbacks in police forces in the western world.

It's crazy to think that a little idea to launch a podcast and write a book could create such an incredible community. This wouldn't be possible without you. 

Two years ago, this was just an idea. I said \"I think I want to do an event and bring people together.\" I get these stories and messages from all of you from all over the world, sharing how the message of the podcast, and the people we bring on are impacting your life. It's supporting you. 

The stories I hear bring me to tears. It's so powerful to hear what you do and what you create in the world. And I'm just trying to facilitate the message by bringing in inspiring and talented, people who lift me up to help me continue to grow. I'm just trying to be a facilitator. 

You guys are the ones who are building the movement. It's incredible how much this has spread from just an idea. If you haven't gotten your tickets yet for the Summit of Greatness, prices go up next Friday, so make sure everyone in your group has their ticket. Summitofgreatness.com

-----
In short, this is for any entrepreneur who wants to grow into becoming the #1 trusted authority in your industry, stand out from the rest, and make a massive impact on your community and the world.

People come to me for coaching for many different reasons...
Some have hundreds of thousands of followers but they aren't bringing in the income they want. Others have all the authority and expertise in the world but have yet to harness their ideas into the programs and courses that will make them financially free.

Still, others have amazing programs and offer but no audience ready to buy them. Some are stuck at the 6 figure level, not sure how to break through to the next level of profit

What most people need is the right coach, accountability from a group of high-level performers who they trust, and the tools and proven information that will get them to the goal they desire.

Since space is very limited, we're accepting participants on a first come, first served basis. You must meet the criteria above to apply and you will get a response if we feel are the right fit for the group

This is audio podcast number #475 with Vanessa Van Edwards
Make sure to leave a comment below and share this with your friends!

Vanessa loves inappropriately intimate questions, peering into people’s shopping carts at the grocery store and eavesdropping on strangers conversations in coffee shops. In other words, she loves to figure people out.

She walks into parties determined to find out the most interesting thing about every person in the room. Vanessa doesn’t believe there are boring people—just individuals afraid to expose who the really are.

https://lewishowes.com/podcast/wellness-wisdom-from-the-masters/

Lately I have been bringing you some mashups, giving you some of the best advice on a specific topic and the response has been overwhelming. I know you love the long interviews, hearing about all aspects of someone’s life – and I’m not going to stop those. I love them too.

But I wanted to take a moment to bring you a best of on something very important to me. It’s something that you need to think about if you want to truly achieve greatness, because without it you can’t go very far.

Yes, I’m talking about health and wellness. Without having good health, you can’t really enjoy your life. Trust me I know. I used to not care about my body at all. I worked all day. I would hardly sleep. I was putting on a lot of weight. So much so people started to call me Flewis (Fat Lewis).

Once I started taking care of myself, that’s when everything changed. I started sleeping better, I had more confidence, and I was a lot more productive. That’s why for this episode of the School of Greatness, I am bringing you a wellness mash up.

Enjoy!

Check Out The School Of Greatness - https://lewishowes.com/start-here/

Dr. Joe Dispenza is an international lecturer, researcher, corporate consultant, New York Times bestselling author, and educator who has been invited to speak in more than 33 countries on 6 continents. As a lecturer and educator, he is driven by the conviction that each of us has the potential for greatness and unlimited abilities.

In his easy-to-understand, compassionate style, he has educated thousands of people, detailing how they can rewire their brains and recondition their bodies to make lasting changes. His most recent book, Becoming Supernatural, talks about how we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical, transcendental experiences and develop a more healthy body, mind, and spiritual life.

I’ve had Dr. Joe on The School of Greatness a couple times now, and I was so excited to have him back on today. We couldn’t meet in person due to the coronavirus, but we conducted a video interview together that I think you’re really going to enjoy. If you haven’t already, check out our past interviews (Episode 826 and Episode 679) — they are all really applicable to what we are going through right now.

In the hard times we are currently facing, it is so important to take a moment to refocus our minds to prevent ourselves from spiraling into anxiety. Anxiety and depression can chemically change our bodies and even suppress our immune system, and now more than ever, it’s important for us to keep that from happening.

Attitude is everything. When we do feel anxious, there are things we can do to recenter ourselves and raise our consciousness to a higher level. To learn how join me on Episode 933 with the incredible Dr. Joe Dispenza.

As a lecturer and educator, he is driven by the conviction that each of us has the potential for greatness and unlimited abilities.

In his easy-to-understand, compassionate style, he has educated thousands of people, detailing how they can rewire their brains and recondition their bodies to make lasting changes. His most recent book, Becoming Supernatural, talks about how we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical, transcendental experiences and develop a more healthy body, mind, and spiritual life.

I’ve had Dr. Joe on The School of Greatness a couple times now, and I was so excited to have him back on today. We couldn’t meet in person due to the coronavirus, but we conducted a video interview together that I think you’re really going to enjoy. If you haven’t already, check out our past interviews (Episode 826 and Episode 679) — they are all really applicable to what we are going through right now.

In the hard times we are currently facing, it is so important to take a moment to refocus our minds to prevent ourselves from spiraling into anxiety. Anxiety and depression can chemically change our bodies and even suppress our immune system, and now more than ever, it’s important for us to keep that from happening.

Attitude is everything. When we do feel anxious, there are things we can do to recenter ourselves and raise our consciousness to a higher level. To learn how join me on Episode 933 with the incredible Dr. Joe Dispenza.

Warning - important message, please read carefully:
The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practiced in the way it is explained. Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced.
Never practice the exercises before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where should you pass out, a serious injury could occur. Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you’ve fainted, it means that you went too far. Take a step back next time.
The cold is a powerful force. We strongly advise to gradually build up exposing yourself to the cold. Always train without force and listen to your body carefully. If it is not practiced responsible, there is a risk of hypothermia.
Do not practice the method during pregnancy or when having epilepsy. Persons with cardiovascular health issues, or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting with the Wim Hof Method.

Her celebrated TED talks have garnered more than 20 million views, and she travels the world to speak about love, sex, intimacy, and infidelity. She is the host of the popular podcast Where Should We Begin? in which she conducts therapy sessions with real couples.

Recently Esther just came out with a new podcast called How’s Work?. In this podcast, Esther addresses workplace relationships, conflicts, and business negotiations via therapy sessions with coworkers and colleagues. How’s Work? is available on Spotify and wherever you get your podcasts!

The first time Esther Perel came on the podcast, she blew me away with her insights about love and intimacy. (A few hundred thousand downloads of that episode later and I know I’m not the only one!). When I had her at the Summit of Greatness, people booed me as I had to wrap up our Q&A — they wanted to hear more.

She truly is an expert on modern relationships, and I was so excited to learn about what she had to say about relationships in the workplace.

If you want to learn more about creating healthy workplace relationships, resolving conflict, and more about fostering intimate relationships with your partner, then tune into Episode 929 to hear from the queen of relationships herself, Esther Perel.

In 2019, Katherine married actor Chris Pratt, and let me tell you — they are relationship goals.  

In 2010, she wrote her first book entitled Rock What You’ve Got: Secrets to Loving Your Inner and Outer Beauty from Someone Who’s Been There and Back. In this book, Katherine describes her personal journey and encourages other young women to achieve confidence and a positive self-image. 

Her fourth book called The Gift of Forgiveness is set for release on March 10. In the book, she interviews 22 different women about their experience overcoming trauma and hurt while figuring out the path to healing and forgiveness. 

Katherine is also a HUGE animal lover. Katherine works as an Ambassador for Best Friends Animal Society and the ASPCA, lending her time, voice, and energy to spread awareness about animal rescue. She rescued her own dog, Maverick, and even wrote a children’s book about him called Maverick and Me. 

Katherine is such a genuinely kind and thoughtful person. I really enjoyed this interview with her and was blown away by the things she had to say.

Are you battling with forgiveness? Do you feel imprisoned by your pain? Then join me on Episode 925 with the wonderful Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt to learn how forgiveness is a step toward healing and greatness.

Bob Proctor is a New York Times bestselling author, motivational speaker, success coach, and expert on the human mind. In short, he’s a master thinker. One of his bestselling books is called You Were Born Rich, which is all about finding success in your present, rather than reaching for it in the future. Bob is also featured in the popular film The Secret, one of the most popular self-help films ever made.

Bob was a high school dropout who started off his career working low-paying jobs. At age 26, Bob read a book that changed his life: Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. Bob moved from making a couple thousand a year to hundreds of thousands to over one million a year. He’s spoken about his journey around the world and has been featured on a number of TV shows, such as Ellen and Larry King Live.

Bob Proctor partnered with attorney Sandy Gallagher to create the Proctor Gallagher Institute. The Institute offers elite programs and coaching courses that teach people how to use the power of their own minds to create an ideal life.

Bob says he was going nowhere before he “woke up” to how the universe works. He’s passionate because he figures that if it could work for him, it could work for anyone.

I had Bob on The School of Greatness back on Episode 835, where we talked about how having an abundance mindset naturally creates an abundant life. Today, we talk about the practical things we can do to change our mindset and set ourselves up for a life of success.

Join me on Episode 950 to learn the secrets to unlock your mind for greatness with the master thinker himself, Bob Proctor." "UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA" "Lewis Howes" "187106" "5485" "134" "0" "534" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKBtPesxp1M"

The motto is \"what's within you is stronger than what's in your way.\" To this aim, Erik continues to challenge himself to live a No Barriers Life and in September 2014 he kayaked the entire 277-miles of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.

Michelle is a wife, a mother, and an amazing UFC fighter. She had a passion for martial arts even as a child but pushed her passion aside to listen to what her parents wanted. She went to college and studied things she didn’t really care about.

One day she was hired to work as a ring girl at a UFC fight and watching the action up close made her decide she wanted to continue her childhood passion. As soon as the semester was over, she left school and started training to be a fighter – but there was only one problem.

At that time there were no UFC women. In fact, the UFC was very clear they were never planning to let women into the UFC. She didn’t let that stop her. She continued to train and take small fights any chance should could. 

Finally, all the hard work paid off. The UFC started letting in women fighters, and she’s had an incredible career that didn’t exist not too long ago. If you’re wondering if you should actually pursue your passion, no matter how unconventional it may be, you need to hear Episode 655.
-----
In This Episode, You Will Learn:
What it is about fighting that Michelle loves (9:02)
Her next step after training in Thailand (13:46)
How long she was an amateur fighter (14:56)
Her biggest fear today (18:08)
What she does to silence the conversations that try to hold her back (20:56)
How she respects her opponents when she’s fighting them (25:02)
How she manages emotional up and downs (28:52)
How she was able to focus on her fights, despite all of her emotional ups and downs (38:32)
The greatest lesson her mom taught her (43:09)

Kevin Hart is a hugely successful comedian, actor, and producer who began his career by sizing men and women for footwear. In his spare time, he would run over to a Philadelphia amateur comedy club to try his hand at stand-up. In his early career, he underwent his fair amount of struggle and criticism, but after dedicated practice and performance, he quit his salesman job to fully pursue comedy. He began performing fulltime, which led to his appearance in several feature films, including Paper Soldiers, Scary Movie 3, and Soul Plane.

In 2102, Kevin released his first stand-up album, titled I’m a Grown Little Man, and has released 4 additional stand-up albums since then. He continues to star in movies, some of his most popular features being Think Like a Man, Get Hard, and Central Intelligence. 

Not only is Kevin Hart one of the world’s favorite comedians and actors, but now he’s your life coach. He just released his new audiobook The Decision, Overcoming Today’s BS for Tomorrow’s Success, which is exclusively available on Audible. In his new audiobook, Kevin gets real and raw about the lessons and skills he’s learned and how they can help you create the life you’ve always dreamed of. It’s not only empowering, but also hysterical — Kevin Hart is truly a life coach like no other!

I cannot stress enough how amazing it was to have this interview with Kevin Hart and hear his perspective of what greatness truly is. You obviously know Kevin as a superstar comedian and actor, but he’s actually one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world, with deeply insightful life-changing advice. 

Obviously, it’s time to stop reading the show notes and jump on right in — Join me on Episode 956 to learn how to overcome self-doubt, learn from mistakes, and embrace your greatest potential with the one and only Kevin Hart!"

It's crazy to think that a little idea to launch a podcast and write a book could create such an incredible community. This wouldn't be possible without you. 

Two years ago, this was just an idea. I said \"I think I want to do an event and bring people together.\" I get these stories and messages from all of you from all over the world, sharing how the message of the podcast, and the people we bring on are impacting your life. It's supporting you. 

The stories I hear bring me to tears. It's so powerful to hear what you do and what you create in the world. And I'm just trying to facilitate the message by bringing in inspiring and talented, people who lift me up to help me continue to grow. I'm just trying to be a facilitator. 

You guys are the ones who are building the movement. It's incredible how much this has spread from just an idea. If you haven't gotten your tickets yet for the Summit of Greatness, prices go up next Friday, so make sure everyone in your group has their ticket. Summitofgreatness.com

She’s also notched more career victories and earned more money total than any woman in history. In 2005, Kerri married fellow American pro-beach-volleyball player and seven-time AVP Open Champion Casey Jennings, and now they have three beautiful children.

Kerri and her husband also founded p1440, the first digital platform built exclusively around beach volleyball and beach culture. From live-streamed competition and behind the scenes stories, to training videos, athlete profiles, and podcasts, they’re creating original content that celebrates the sport, the athletes, and the beach volleyball lifestyle. The name p1440 is based on the Jennings’ way of life: to live all 1440 minutes of the day with passion and purpose.

The Tokyo Olympics were actually supposed to start this week — crazy, isn’t it?! — and Kerri was aiming for redemption after finishing third in Rio in 2016. So it seemed like a perfect time to bring you this interview. We sat down for a wide-ranging conversation back in early spring, before we knew the full scope of the coronavirus pandemic, but Kerri’s wisdom is incredibly relevant at this moment.

Her debut book, I’m Judging You: The Do-Better Manual, was an instant bestseller when it was released in 2016. In this hilarious book of essays, Luvvie Ajayi inspires us to have good behavior, one sharp and funny side-eye at a time. It’s a book that will make you laugh and also make you think.

Luvvie is an internationally-recognized speaker with a highly popular TED Talk, Get Comfortable with Being Uncomfortable, which has over 5 million views and has been transcribed into 22 languages! Her podcast,  Rants & Randomness, is also a massive hit with over 2 million downloads! In the podcast, she discusses life, lessons, and the pursuit of always doing better.

Luvvie has received numerous accolades, including being chosen by Oprah Winfrey as part of her inaugural SuperSoul100 list as someone who “elevates humanity.”  At the base of it all, Luvvie is committed to creating content and doing work that informs, inspires, and convicts others to make positive change. What started as a hobby has become a global business and has allowed her to help people in more ways than she could have ever imagined.

I am so excited to share this conversation with you. If you’re finding value in Luvvie’s wisdom, make sure you share it as well with someone who needs to hear it! We could all use the encouragement to chase our dreams and not let fear and failure get in the way of becoming who we’re meant to be!

Ed started out with the dream of playing professional baseball. But like so many of us, an injury changed his course in life.

Instead, his first job out of college was helping boys at a foster home who came from abused families. It’s here he found his life mission: to serve.

He saw in the eyes of these boys that they wanted what everyone wants – to be loved and appreciated. This ended up taking him down the road of servitude later in life.

Today, Ed is one of the premier business leaders, peak performance experts, and motivational speakers in the world. He has a passion for mentoring and coaching others on what it takes to become a champion in all areas of life.

He has shared the stage and has very close personal relationships with other business legends such as Tony Robbins, John Maxwell, Phil Knight and many others." "UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA" "Lewis Howes" "13008" "533" "16" "0" "81" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt1hCwalT58"

His book series Rich Dad Poor Dad is an international bestseller. It compares his two “dads”: one was his poor biological father and the other was his ‘fictitious’ rich dad.

Through this journey, I’ve become aware of the things that have been holding me back as a human being, not just as a man, but as a human, in terms of being resentful, guarded, frustrated and defensive. But I recognize men and women might wonder, \"What’s in this book specifically for me?\"

WHAT’S IN IT FOR MEN?

Understand what holds you back from your most powerful self
Develop an unwavering foundation of confidence in any situation
Propel you to a level of power and success that you may have never thought possible
Embrace and let go of any fears that hold you back from your dreams
Let go of all pressure, stress, and anxiety, so you can finally feel free
Experience more joy, happiness, and love in all of your relationships
WHAT’S IN IT FOR WOMEN?

Women will:

Understand the men in your life better
Learn ways you can emotionally support the men you love
Learn powerful tools to connect more intimately in your relationships
Learn how to get men you love to open up and be more vulnerable

Understand why men act guarded, and how to help them open up
IT’S TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY.

Wim Hof was born in the Netherlands, where winter is a way of life. As a kid, he felt a sudden urge to jump into a freezing-cold river. So, he did. And while most of us would immediately regret that decision and vow to never do it again … Wim went the other way and made it his profession.

In the coming years, Wim made subjecting himself to extreme feats of cold endurance his personal claim to fame. He set a world record time (two hours, 16 minutes) for a barefoot half-marathon in freezing conditions. Another for spending nearly two hours in full-body contact with a solid slab of ice. He also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in shorts — you know, it’s causal.

Yet another world record almost didn’t make it into the books when Wim literally froze one of his corneas during a practice run for an under-ice distance swim, but after a good night’s rest, his eye healed up enough that he successfully set the record the next day.

It’s straight-up superhero stuff. They call him the “Iceman” for a reason.

And somewhere along the way, Wim figured out that as he achieved these superhuman feats of endurance, he was doing something a little different. The Wim Hof Breathing Method helped him bolster his system both prior to and during these incredible physical challenges.

His special breathing method can not only help you master the elements but also take control over your own immune system. Wim Hof participated in a research study where he was injected with an endotoxin, one that was supposed to make you sick within minutes but using his own breathing method and technique, he was not affected. That’s right — Wim Hof gained control over his autonomous nervous system.

I’ve had Wim on The School of Greatness a few times now, and each time it’s so interesting to hear his perspective and see the results of his methods. Check out Episode 398, Episode 799, and our recent roundtable interview, Episode 910, to hear more!

Join me on Episode 941 to learn how we can strengthen our immune systems and defend ourselves against anything — even the coronavirus — with the incredible Wim Hof!" "UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA" "Lewis Howes" "79171" "2020" "56" "0" "325" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52-i7h8a1g"

Matt and I met a couple years ago around a TV show that he was a matchmaker on and I was impressed not only by his dating savvy but by his business savvy as well.

He is now a regular on the Today Show and hosts live events that close to 100,000 women have attended.

And his YouTube videos where he gives dating advice are amazing (I watch them myself).

He came by my studio and we had an awesome conversation (which could have gone on for hours) about the best ways to actually meet someone you are interested in. He also gave great advice about keeping desire in your existing relationship.

Beyond his tips, however, Matt dove into the other reasons we struggle to meet the partner of our dreams – and it has a lot to do with entitlement." "UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA" "Lewis Howes" "33000" "823" "45" "0" "91" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCXqymgjPmU"

Free Brand Strategy Call: https://www.lewishowes.com/brandcall 
-----

Rory and I met years ago and would meet up every once in a while at different events. But it wasn’t until I felt the need to call him a couple of months ago that I truly learned about Rory’s genius.

I was feeling a little uneasy about what to do next with my personal brand and business. I knew I needed to get an outside set of expert eyes on it. So I called Rory out of the blue and asked if I could come meet him to talk about it. Rory not only gave me two days of his time and hosted me at his house, he gave me such valuable insight into my business and brand that I am shifting my entire focus as a result.

I want to share this same information and insight with as many people as possible, so Rory flew out to record a podcast episode all about how he thinks about branding (and what he helps his clients do). He even offered free brand strategy calls to any School of Greatness podcast listeners if you are interested in becoming an influential personal brand.

This conversation is a goldmine, and I can’t wait for you to take tons of notes on it in Episode 670.

Jesse enjoys living life “out of the box.” In fact, he doesn’t even have a box. The author of the New York Times bestseller, Living with a Seal, co founded Marquis Jet, the world’s largest private jet card company which he and his partner sold to Berkshire Hathaway/NetJets. Jesse then partnered with Zico coconut water, which he and his partner sold to The Coca-Cola Company.

He’s also the kind of person that when he wants something he grabs onto the opportunity without delay. He recently decided he needed to detox his mind from electronics and the constant multitasking of today’s world.

He ended up living with monks, living in a room as small as a table, and unable to communicate with his family, just to find himself.

The lessons he learned most were about the need to make time for yourself and the people around you that you care most about. In the end, that’s where you’ll have the most impact and where your true legacy will come from.

Learn more lessons from Jesse’s isolation and time with the monks, on Episode 652.

MY ENTIRE LIFE, I GREW UP AS AN ATHLETE.

I was a two-sport All-American, played pretty much every sport in high school, and went on to play arena football professionally.

My entire childhood was built on beliefs about what \"masculinity\" is, from being in the locker rooms, to what coaches would say to me over and over, to society, and what the media showed.

I was raped when I was five by a man that I didn't know, the babysitter's son. I didn’t tell anyone about it. I remember having all this resentment, anger, frustration and defensiveness built up inside of me.

I became so driven to prove everyone wrong, so driven to be number one and to never lose.

I was driven to be the best athlete I could be.

A lot of it came from feeling like I wasn't good enough for who I was.

People questioned my masculinity, my value, so I was very driven to achieve. And I did.

I achieved everything I wanted. I seemed to have it all: a New York Times bestselling book, a world-famous podcast, a multi-million dollar business.

At 32-years-old, I had reached the pinnacle of success by anyone’s measure.

But deep down, I felt utterly unfulfilled.

Night after night on my book tour for The School of Greatness, I would lay down only to feel deep and profound loneliness in an impersonal hotel room.

I may have reached the pinnacle of success, but I had no one to share it with.

I had no intimacy or deep connection with anyone else.

In the past, I would have ignored these emotions. \"Man up,\" I would have told myself. \"Quit being so soft.\" But as the book tour came to a close, I decided it was time to do things differently. It was time to take massive action.

So I went on a personal journey to find inner peace and uncover the many masks that men - like myself - wear.

I had life-changing conversations with some of the world’s best psychologists, researchers, and household names, such as Tony Robbins, Alanis Morissette, and Ray Lewis. And through it all, I discovered what it really takes to remove the mask of masculinity.

I realized there are so many men out there struggling because of these ideas of \"masculinity.\"

The Mask of Masculinity: How Men Can Embrace Vulnerability, Create Strong Relationships, and Live Their Fullest Lives is the result of this transformational journey.

I know there are a lot of people talking about vulnerability, opening up, and similar topics, but as a jock growing up in America, none of my peers would've ever listened to any of those messages from those people.

I want to connect with the men who are not open to hearing this message, in a way that will resonate with them.

I want women to understand the men in their lives better.

Through entertaining stories, honest reflection, and incredible interviews, I uncovered the 9 masks of masculinity: the hidden psychological and emotional barriers that hold men back from true fulfillment. In each chapter, we explore the depths of a different mask.

For many, The Mask of Masculinity will be the start of a life-changing journey.

Many men have worn their masks for so long that they forget who they are underneath. Removing the masks, then, will not be easy.

It will be terrifying. It will be painful. But it’s in the most difficult and challenging journeys that we find the most meaning. Stripped of the masks of masculinity, men can find true fulfillment. They can love. They can connect. They can find the freedom to be themselves again.

Sally Kohn is a CNN commentator who has attracted huge amounts of haters during her career as a political speaker. As our society has gotten more divided, hate seems to be taking over a lot of actions and discussions. So Sally decided to do a deep dive study on why we hate and what the opposite of that is. She talked to her own haters, she traveled to countries that have experienced genocides, and she discussed the psychological pieces of what’s going on.

This was a powerful conversation about a topic that isn’t always easy to discuss. I really appreciated Sally’s willingness and honesty in discussing how we can each shift our habits out of hate and bias and into open-mindedness and respect. No matter what you’ve been through or what you believe, I know there’s something valuable to learn for all of us in Episode 631.

Sometimes success will come to you from the strangest places. It may seem like your passions won’t pay off, but if you push through and continue to grow you’ll find a way to have it work. It won’t be easy, and there will be plenty of times you’ll want to give up. It may even seem like the smart thing to do. But if you want to feel fulfilled and happy, it can’t be about the money.

It has to be about the love of what you do, and trust that the money will come later. The perfect example of this comes from today’s guest, Tony Hawk.

I used to love watching Tony Hawk on the X Games. He was an instant legend, and an icon in something that no one saw as a sport when he started out. In fact, learning a new trick was frowned upon when he was starting out.

Today, today is one of the most respected athletes there is. He’s a household name and continues to push the boundaries.

I have a confession to make - I’ve been keeping a little bit of a secret. But the time has finally come to share with you - and the world - something I’m tremendously excited about. For the past two years, my team and I have been working on a documentary film. It’s called Chasing Greatness. And I can’t wait to share it with you.

It’s all about what greatness means. Harnessing your dreams. Overcoming your fears. Realizing your power. Achieving your best life. And showing a career-spanning level of appreciation for you, and all you’ve done to make the most of all we are together.

The film takes you on a seven-day behind the scenes journey of our life-changing annual event, The Summit of Greatness. More than 1,500 people travel from around the world to attend each year in my hometown Columbus, Ohio. You’ll witness candid conversations with my family, team meetings, backstage production, and never before seen sit-downs with our speakers on how we can all reach our highest potential.

You’re also probably aware that sleep quality is part of the equation (not just quantity).

But did you realize that what time of day you go to bed, what you do for the two hours leading up to that, and what you do when you wake up have a big impact on your sleep?

Because I’m obsessed with learning how to optimize everything for greatness that I can, I’ve started paying more attention to the little habits in my life that can have big results.

Shawn is not only a sleep expert and best-selling author, but he has spent the last ten plus years studying how to optimize all parts of your daily routine to help you function at maximum capacity.

He is a fountain of knowledge about everything from eating right to setting up your bedroom to how sex affects sleep!

Dr. Peterson is a professor at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and the author of the million-plus selling 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (Jan 2018, Penguin Books), which has been a Number 1 bestseller in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands and Brazil, and which is now slated to be translated into 40 languages. His now-classic book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (just released as an audiobook) offers a revolutionary take on the psychology of religion, and the hundred or more scientific papers he published with his colleagues and students have substantively advanced the modern understanding of creativity and personality. He is is regarded by his current University of Toronto students as one of three truly life-changing professors, and was nominated for the prestigious Levinson Teaching Prize as a Harvard professor. His classroom lectures on mythology and the psychology of religion, based on Maps of Meaning, were turned into a popular 13-part TV series on TVO.

Show notes: http://lewishowes.com/285
-----
Yes, we are talking about relationships again on  The School of Greatness.
Partly because I love learning as much as possible about how to create and maintain healthy, amazing relationships (and I need a lot of coaching in my love life). But partly because I heard today’s guest speaker at Summit at Sea in November and I knew I had to have her on the podcast.

Esther Perel is a world-renowned relationship therapist, bestselling author, and sought-after speaker who has focused her career on exploring the role of sex and eroticism in making and breaking intimate relationships. She has an incredible world-view of relationships in many different cultures, which has allowed her to see what works and what doesn’t on a bigger level.

I asked her a ton of questions in our interview and she had answers. You may already have set ideas about what intimate relationships should look like, but I know you’ll get some new perspective from listening to this interview. Get ready to get vulnerable with yourself as you take a look at your relationships in Episode 285 with Esther Perel.

He has published 20 books, and he is a contributor to publications including The Financial Times and The Huffington Post. He is also the host of The James Altucher Show in which he interviews innovators, creators, and just all-around amazing people. James has founded or cofounded more than 20 companies, 17 of which have failed, but he hasn’t let this slow him down.

Failure is a big part of James’ story. In fact, I believe that anyone who is remotely successful has probably experienced an extraordinary amount of failure in their life. Why? Because overcoming failure is a step towards success.

At one point, James lost almost all his money. He was completely broke. He had less than two hundred dollars in his bank account. But somehow, he was able to build his business back up, and change that two hundred dollars into fifteen million.

Want to learn his secret? Then tune into Episode 922 and get ready to be blown away by entrepreneur, author, and hair inspiration, James Altucher.

She has developed her own style that is frequently referred to as “life changing.”

Marisa also studied hypnotherapy at the Hypnotism Training Institute of Los Angeles, known as the best hypnotherapy training establishment in the world. She developed her own brand of treatment, Rapid Transformational Therapy, which is a combination of hypnosis, neuro-linguistic programming, and cognitive behavioral therapy. By guiding her patients into a state of relaxation and hypnosis, Marisa Peer is better able to find the root of psychological distress and provide suggestions in order to heal that distress.

Marisa Peer also started the radical #iamenough movement. By just saying those three words repeatedly – I am enough – you can change your brain’s thought patterns and come to a place of self-love.

Marisa is the bestselling author of several books, including I Am Enough: Mark Your Mirror and Change Your Life, and makes frequent appearances on TV and radio. She’s helped thousands of people overcome a variety of issues, and is motivated to train others to do the same. I was honored to have Marisa Peer speak on my podcast.

"791" "Wi-CeCnmdos" "The Power of Innovation (Coffee Conversation)" "2018-07-16T04:14:47Z" "A business is very similar to any personal relationships you have in life. They follow a lot of the same rules if you want them to be successful. Whether you’re working on the next Amazon, courting someone new, or trying to build a relationship with your child, you need to be innovative.

Innovation is all about assessing the situation. See what’s working and what’s not. Sometimes you may need an outsider’s view to see the problem areas. Most importantly, innovation comes from listening, really hearing out your clients and your loved ones.

They are constantly trying to reach out and tell you exactly what it is they want — even though it’s not always with their words. These are important lessons I’ve learned the hard way while growing my own business and that’s why I thought it would be good to bring you an episode of Coffee Conversations with my good friend (and COO) Cesar to discuss this topic.

In This Episode, You Will Learn:
Why you need to think about reinvesting in the future (6:18)
The three things we’ve got coming up (9:27)
How you need to think if you want to grow your business (11:09)

Dr. Chatterjee is a medical doctor who decided to rethink the way we do medicine. He’s decided that physicians need to be more holistic in their approach to treating patients and help their lifestyle as opposed to just giving them a quick fix. He has become the star of the hit BBC series Doctor in the House where he analyzes every aspect of people’s lives to help with their illness. Dr. Chatterjee has made it his goal to simplify the way the average person thinks about healthcare. He’s divided health into four easy pillars that allow anyone with a chronic disease to retake control of their lives.

Bob is one of the most interesting people I’ve ever met. He used to be a lawyer, and turned his life into one designed to spread love. He has written New York Times best selling books, and is a phenomenal speaker. He’s helped build schools and shelters around the world. He’s saved lives by educating witch doctors in other countries, and has even become the Uganda consulate to the US.This was easily one of the most interesting interviews I’ve ever done.Bob’s mission is one I truly believe in. And believe it or not despite everything he’s done he still gets haters on social media.

We discuss how he deals with those haters, how you can love deeper, and how you can overcome your insecurities.

Through this journey, I’ve become aware of the things that have been holding me back as a human being, not just as a man, but as a human, in terms of being resentful, guarded, frustrated and defensive. But I recognize men and women might wonder, \"What’s in this book specifically for me?\"

WHAT’S IN IT FOR MEN?

Men will:

Understand what holds you back from your most powerful self
Develop an unwavering foundation of confidence in any situation
Propel you to a level of power and success that you may have never thought possible
Embrace and let go of any fears that hold you back from your dreams
Let go of all pressure, stress, and anxiety, so you can finally feel free
Experience more joy, happiness, and love in all of your relationships
WHAT’S IN IT FOR WOMEN?

Women will:

Understand the men in your life better
Learn ways you can emotionally support the men you love
Learn powerful tools to connect more intimately in your relationships
Learn how to get men you love to open up and be more vulnerable
Understand what holds the men in your life back
Understand why men act guarded, and how to help them open up
IT’S TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY.

In his career, he has worked with everyone from business leaders to sports superstars. You may have heard of companies like Nike, GE, Coca-Cola, NASA, and Microsoft — Robin Sharma has coached them all. He’s here to serve the world and teach us all how we can be great.

Beyond being an excellent coach, Robin Sharma’s books have influenced millions of people to become their highest selves. His bestselling book The 5 AM Club is an incredible testament to over 20 years working, leading, and serving with love and wisdom.

But Robin didn’t start out as the genius and masterful teacher he is today. Way back in the 90s, he was working as a litigation lawyer. He went to work day in and day out, but eventually, he realized something was missing. Every time he looked in the mirror, he wasn’t happy with the face that was staring back at him. 

So he decided to change his life. He left his job and went on a journey to research and meet as many great men and women as possible. He learned about everyone from Shakespeare to Joan of Arc to Nelson Mandela, taking as much wisdom as possible and growing into a man who could be a cultural icon.

Out of that experience, Robin self-published his first book, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, which went on to become a #1 bestseller. Robin started giving seminars on the book — his first-ever seminar had an audience of 23 people, 21 of whom were family — and from there, he worked to steadily grow his reach and serve more people with his message of self-awareness and greatness.

Today, Robin Sharma’s podcast, The Mastery Sessions, reaches tons of new listeners every day. Robin continues his work coaching and teaching millions of people to level-up their lives and be as great as possible. 

I interviewed Robin back on Episode 754, so be sure to check out that interview after listening to this one! Robin has so many tools, tips, and strategies that you can start using to change your life for the better!

Make sure to leave a comment below and share this with your friends!

Vanessa loves inappropriately intimate questions, peering into people’s shopping carts at the grocery store and eavesdropping on strangers conversations in coffee shops. In other words, she loves to figure people out.

She walks into parties determined to find out the most interesting thing about every person in the room. Vanessa doesn’t believe there are boring people—just individuals afraid to expose who the really are.

She’s allergic to uninteresting conversation, isn’t afraid to call BS and has long given up on social niceties.

She power poses anytime, anywhere with anyone…

We’ve had some amazing spiritual leaders on the show, from all different backgrounds, so I thought it would be cool to do a Masters mashup episode on spiritual truths.

The response to these mashup episodes from the archives has been so great, I’m going to keep them coming.

This one features 4 clips from some of the wisest spiritual minds I’ve ever met.

First, we hear from John Gray about how we can see our biggest mistakes and challenges being used for good in our lives.

Then we hear from Marianne Williamson about the difference between pain and suffering (and that we have a choice about how to respond to them).

Next, there’s a great nugget from Danielle LaPorte about why it’s so important to be your own guru when it comes to walking your spiritual path.

And lastly, we end with Rob Bell talking about why he believes God has put paradox into every truth (and why that is a good thing).

I loved each of these episodes, and I think you’ll get as much value as I did by revisiting them in Episode 641.

Through this journey, I’ve become aware of the things that have been holding me back as a human being, not just as a man, but as a human, in terms of being resentful, guarded, frustrated and defensive. But I recognize men and women might wonder, \"What’s in this book specifically for me?\"

WHAT’S IN IT FOR MEN?

Men will:

Understand what holds you back from your most powerful self
Develop an unwavering foundation of confidence in any situation
Propel you to a level of power and success that you may have never thought possible
Embrace and let go of any fears that hold you back from your dreams
Let go of all pressure, stress, and anxiety, so you can finally feel free
Experience more joy, happiness, and love in all of your relationships
WHAT’S IN IT FOR WOMEN?

Women will:

Understand the men in your life better
Learn ways you can emotionally support the men you love
Learn powerful tools to connect more intimately in your relationships
Learn how to get men you love to open up and be more vulnerable
Understand what holds the men in your life back
Understand why men act guarded, and how to help them open up
IT’S TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE MEN BEHIND THE MASKS OF MASCULINITY.

It's crazy to think that a little idea to launch a podcast and write a book could create such an incredible community. This wouldn't be possible without you. Two years ago, this was just an idea. I said \"I think I want to do an event and bring people together.\" I get these stories and messages from all of you from all over the world, sharing how the message of the podcast, and the people we bring on are impacting your life. It's supporting you. The stories I hear bring me to tears. It's so powerful to hear what you do and what you create in the world. And I'm just trying to facilitate the message by bringing in inspiring and talented, people who lift me up to help me continue to grow. I'm just trying to be a facilitator. You guys are the ones who are building the movement. It's incredible how much this has spread from just an idea.

Michael Bennett is an NFL star, defensive lineman, 3-time Pro Bowler, and a Super Bowl Champion with the Seattle Seahawks’ Legion of Boom… and he’s all of that despite being undrafted out of college!

In addition to his athletic accomplishments, Michael is one of the more outspoken players in the NFL and a true leader in his community when it comes to social justice. When Colin Kaepernick started kneeling in protest of racial injustice, Michael immediately joined in support.

In 2018, Michael became a New York Times Bestselling Author with his book, Things That Make White People Uncomfortable. Now, he’s hosting a podcast with his wife, Pele, that’s called Mouthpeace, which encourages difficult conversations on a wide range of topics, including racism, sex, and sports. 

Author William Faulkner said, “Never be afraid to raise your voice for honesty and truth and compassion against injustice and lying and greed.” Michael Bennett is the perfect example of someone who speaks truth and justice boldly in the face of racial prejudice. I am so thankful for the opportunity to listen and learn from him.

Laverne Cox is a three-time Emmy Award-nominated actress, an Emmy-winning producer, and the executive producer of the new Netflix documentary, Disclosure, a film that examines how transgender people have been depicted in film and television over the past century.

Laverne is a pioneering transgender activist with a staggering list of achievements and acknowledgments, including being the first openly transgender person to grace the cover of Time magazine and the first to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy in an acting category. She also debuted in the groundbreaking role of Sophia Burset, in the critically acclaimed Netflix original series “Orange is The New Black.” Laverne is the first trans woman of color to have a leading role on a mainstream scripted television show.

With various ‘firsts’ in her already impressive career, Laverne Cox continues to make history in her career and significant strides in her activism. It was such an honor to speak with Laverne — our conversation was powerful, profound, and at times painful. Even though we’ve made progress, there is still so much prejudice and hatred in the world against minorities, and we need to be doing everything we can to make the world a more positive, welcoming place.

One last note — We taped this interview before I got a chance to watch Disclosure, which is a truly incredible, impactful documentary. Please find time to go watch it.

In my other online courses, I dive into some of my favorite personal growth strategies, webinar secrets, and product creation processes. But never before have I taken all of those teachings (and more) and thrown them into the same, powerful video training.
 
And never before have I made it free just for you.
 
I created this new FREE video series that will teach you everything you need to know to grow your online business and leave a lasting legacy.

Everything from branding, to email marketing strategies, to social media optimization, product design, website creation, public speaking lessons…

All of the best and most powerful lessons from my Legacy course, they’re all here. 
 
ANNOUNCING: The Master Profit Plan.

In the first video of this FREE training series, I will walk you step-by-step through how I’ve built my online business and created the life of my dreams.

Learn the strategies and the lessons I wish I had known when I was just starting and building my first online business.  
 
It’s all here in this video series and it’s all FREE.

Now I know that you’re a budding entrepreneur, and you want to learn as much as you can about business (I know this because I always want to keep learning too).

And I know there are so many other “gurus” out there offering free trainings for entrepreneurs looking to grow their businesses (I know because I’ve seen them all myself).

But they haven’t built a business like I have. They don’t have a NY Times Bestselling book. And they don’t interview the best of the best on one of the top podcasts in the world.

My experience, my failures, and my successes are what make this training series special.

I’ve gotten plenty of scrapes and bruises on my way towards building an online empire. I’ve tried platforms that don’t work and strategies that have flopped. I’ve made plenty of mistakes.

I want to help you avoid making them too. And I want to help you build the business and the life you’ve imagined.

Because at the end of the day, my whole goal with The School of Greatness and everything else I do is to support you in becoming the greatest version of yourself.

That is exactly why I’ve put this video series together for you. 
In the first video of The Master Profit Plan, you will learn:
The 5 Keys to Online Business Success - these are the ESSENTIAL pieces you want to get right when you’re creating business growth strategies, no matter what kind of business you are in.
The 4 Amazing Benefits to Having an Online Business - you’ve gotten a taste of this with 7-Figure Webinars, but I dive even deeper in this training.
How I found the guts to start all this from nothing - because if a clueless, dyslexic 20-something kid from Ohio can do it, so can you.

BELIEVING IS ABOUT MORE THAN SEEING.

Influence is a very powerful thing. It can be used to change an individual’s impression or used to move the masses. It’s something that can be done for good or for bad. Too much of it is a dangerous thing, but not enough will leave you stuck in one place in life. On this episode of The School of Greatness, I have brought on someone I’ve wanted to have on for a long time: Lior Suchard.

Lior is an amazing mentalist, who uses his power of influence to entertain the masses. I’ve seen him live, and I was so glad that he was final able to come into the studio and blow my (and Christine’s) mind!
Lior explains his process of influence and how he is able to use how “power” for good instead of evil. We discuss such topics as how he can create the illusion of more senses. We talk about the difference between a magician and a mentalist, and how YOU can tap into your intuition.

I have to admit, my mind is still spinning after this one. You’ll want to listen to it, and if you can’t believe your eyes, watch the video and you’ll see the proof of what happened.

So get ready to tap into your powers on Episode 673.

She specializes in the mind-body connection, and her research is impacting tons of people and empowering them to manage their stress and start living happier and more hopeful lives.

Kelly has written multiple books, often drawing from the popular courses she teaches at Stanford for research and inspiration. Her first book, The Willpower Instinct, is based on her course “The Science of Willpower,” and her second, The Upside of Stress, grew out of the course “Living Well with Stress.” Her latest book, The Joy of Movement, didn’t grow out of a class, but it’s still full of great information about how physical exercise can be a powerful antidote for anxiety, depression, and loneliness.

In addition to being a prolific writer and popular Stanford professor, Kelly’s also a hit on YouTube! Her TED Talk, “How to Make Stress Your Friend,” has received over 10 million views, and I have a feeling it’s about to receive a lot more. It’s an inspiring message about why stress can actually be helpful, and it suggests that reaching out to others can be an incredible way to reduce stress in our lives.

Beyond her academic work, Kelly is passionate about giving back, and she does a lot of work with the Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism. In fact, she helped create the Stanford Compassion Cultivation Training, a course taught worldwide to help individuals develop greater empathy, compassion, and social connection.

And as if all that weren’t enough, Oprah’s O Magazine named Kelly the first-ever O! Visionary and celebrated her as a person whose groundbreaking way of seeing the world means a better future for us all.

Kelly McGonigal is an inspiring person. Her research is making the world a better, less stressed-out place every day. I’m so excited to have her here on The School of Greatness today!
